25,adunn24,1593643176,69,1,"In 2015-2016 the 73-9 Warriors may have been the most beautiful team assembled just on pure basketball and play style. It was such a deep roster with great bench and veteran status along with superstar Steph and a great backcourt with Klay. They also had Draymond who was their energy and soul along with the defensive anchor. Draymond made it a mission to guard players with intensity that season, and had been making a great impact even in the finals up 3-1 against the Cavs in the finals. The issue I had with Draymond’s suspension was that it created a clear loss for Golden State in Game 6. People have been talking about “asterisks” for this coming playoffs, but in my opinion I almost see those finals as asterisks, because I think if Draymond doesn’t get suspended they may end the series in Game 5, or even Game 6 rather than choking the entire series.. and this potentially changes the face of the entire nba.",nba,Would the Warriors have won a title in 2015-2016 if Draymond didn’t get suspended?

28,Nopementator,1593642795,24,1,"I watched MJ since early 90's and I think that Kobe has been the hardest opponent he ever faced. 

We're talking about Kobe in his sophomore season against a 35 years MJ, so kinda a ""balanced"" duel because MJ wasn't the same athlete so he couldn't dominate with his elite athleticism, and Kobe was super athletic but with little experience.

Still, nobody ever gave MJ so much work on both side of the floor and showed like Kobe did zero sign of feat facing such duel.

Now, since we can't really take into consideration their duel when MJ was with Washington, I've to think that 19 yrs Kobe was something MJ never faced before. Which is curious.

If bad boys were the hardest defense MJ ever faced, none of them was also going at MJ on offense as a 25-30pts threat every game as Kobe would've been, and when MJ faced for example Drexler in 1992 finals, he faced a potential threat on offense but not on defense.

This lead to wonder how incredible an actual duel between let's say 1992 MJ vs 2006/2008 Kobe could've had been.

\*I'm saying this with a sort of unbiased mindset since I'm not a fan of any of them.",nba,It's possible that the hardest 1vs1 opponent on both side of the floor MJ ever faced was a 19 years old Kobe Bryant

MLS has been embarking on a similar restart strategy to the NBA, even setting up in the same area. 3rd Degree (an independent FC Dallas blog) (confirmed)[https://3rddegree.net/sources-three-more-fc-dallas-covid-positive-tests-on-tuesday-thats-six-since-arrival-and-nine-overall] that all of these FC Dallas players tested negative for COVID-19 before entering the MLS bubble, and positive after entering it. 

There are multiple reasons this could be the case. The original tests may have been flawed, they may have caught it in between testing and entering the bubble, and they may have contracted it while inside the bubble from someone who hasn't been tested. It's been noted by both (Zach Lowe)[https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2897065-report-nba-players-have-covid-19-test-concerns-for-disney-staff-leaving-bubble] and (the Actors' Equity Association)[https://www.wdwinfo.com/news-stories/actors-equity-asks-walt-disney-world-to-offer-covid-19-testing-consider-reopening-delay/] (the union in charge of the costumed and stage workers at Disney World) that WDW is [i]not[/i] providing testing for many of its workers, let alone mandating it. 

Even if this lack of testing only applied to costumed workers, what if they pass it to the workers doing laundry, or others who may have direct contact with NBA players and representatives? I think the chance that COVID-19 spreads through the NBA even inside the bubble is more likely than many people think.",nba,Six FC Dallas players have tested already positive for COVID-19 since arriving in the MLS bubble in Orlando

62,DirtyDanoTho,1593634219,85,1,"It honestly baffles me as to why the Kings have left him there. He's done such an awful job it's ridiculous. Here's a current outlook of the team:

#Core

**De'Aaron Fox** - 22 year old PG - Great asset, he is without a doubt the centerpiece of the team

**Marvin Bagley** - 21 year old PF/C - Looks kind of promising as a piece but he can't seem to stay healthy and get into a rhythm. I haven't given up on him becoming a decent player but obviously he's never gonna be as good as that guy that was drafted after him.

**Thoughts:** As a viewer, realistically these are what I'd consider the core pieces moving forward. These two are the only ones I'd bet on making a jump to becoming great players. This core to me seems kind of small, but there isn't much else to bet and build on. Divac has been unable to bring in any more young pieces to build around

#Supporting cast

**Buddy Hield** - 27 year old SG - Solid player but he kind of is what he is at this point. Super limited defensively but good offensive piece, his timeline doesn't seem to line up with what you want out of the team at the moment though

**Richaun Holmes** - 26 year old C - I actually really like the way this guy plays, he can do everything you want from a C and he's average to above average at it. Decent glue guy.

**Bogdan Bogdanovic** - 27 year old SG - To me he seems like your average 6th man. Nothing about his game really wows me and he's limited defensively as well. Also kind of old relative to the core of Fox and Bagley

**Harry Giles** - 21 year old C - Looks like he's gonna be a career bench guy, kind of like a DeWayne Dedmon.

**Harrison Barnes** - 28 year old F - Very middle of the pack player, in a wing driven league you want someone better as your SF. He's an average defender and scorer and doesn't really do much else. Advanced stats have never really liked him and he's pretty much my idea of a replacement level starter. He isn't gonna improve and doesn't match up with the core's timeline at the moment. Super questionable giving him a 4 year 85m contract when there didn't seem to be other bidders

**Nemanja Bjelica** - 32 year old PF - I mean he can shoot 🤷‍♂️

**Thoughts:** Besides Hield and Holmes, nobody here really has any value. They're all plateaued and average at best, clearly they're missing some pieces, but none of what they have even really matches up with the timeline of Fox. This supporting cast tells me that they've pretty much been making decisions with no direction in mind. They aren't good enough to be an old team, but they aren't young enough to be a team with potential. A reasonable GM would dump a lot of what they have for picks which is kind of a shitty situation. They aren't getting rid of that Barnes contract but Buddy Hield and Bogdanovic could net some nice pieces.

#Picks

Moving forward they have all of their first rounders, no additional first rounders, but some additional 2nd rounders. They haven't really collected that many picks and they are likely to be at the end of the lottery for a while.

***

So it's clear that at the moment they aren't in a good position, lets look at the highlights and lowlights of the transactions that got them here starting from 2016.

#Transactions 

###2016-17

**Traded Marquese Chriss to the Phoenix Suns for rights to Bogdan Bogdanović, Skal Labissière, Georgios Papagiannis and a 2020 2nd round draft pick. 2020 2nd-rd pick is DET's pick**

Now Chriss didn't turn out to be great right off of the bat(I blame Phoenix) but holy shit Papagiannis didn't last 2 years in Sacramento, he might've had the most predictable career I've seen from any lottery pick. Everyone knew that was an awful pick and it stayed awful.  Skal also turned out bad. Now while Bogdanovic is ok, they traded an athletic player with good potential for a decent low floor, low ceiling role player, 2 pieces of crap, and a 2nd rounder.

**Traded Marco Belinelli to the Charlotte Hornets for Malachi Richardson.**

Now this wasn't that bad a trade at the time but it kind of shows the direction they wanted to go at this point. Why would they make that Chriss trade?

**Traded Omri Casspi and DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans for Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, Buddy Hield, a 2017 1st round draft pick and a 2017 2nd round draft pick (Frank Mason III was later selected). (2017 1st-rd pick is top-3 protected) (2017 2nd-rd pick going to SAC is PHI's pick)**

I mean this trade wasn't that awful in hindsight tbh but maybe they could've gotten some better and younger talent for Cousins. If he seriously thought Buddy Hield was gonna be as good as Steph Curry he was out of his mind.

###2017-18

**Drafted De'Aaron Fox**

Kind of his only great decision.

**Traded 10th pick Zach Collins to the Portland Trail Blazers for 20th pick Harry Giles and 15th pick Justin Jackson.**

Wow Justin Jackson sucks. Seems that Vlade has been valuing quantity over quality when it comes to the draft. Zach Collins, Luke Kennard, Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo were still on the board but he got more crap in Jackson with a bench guy in Giles. Even if he made the trade those picks were still bad. You had John Collins, Jarrett Allen, and OG Anunoby still on the board but he missed on them. I don't blame him for picking Giles cause he seemed like a solid pick at the time but his scouts couldn't do better than Jackson at 15?

**Signed George Hill to a multi-year contract. 57m/3 years**

Why sign a 31 year old to that much money when you're looking to go young? To mentor Fox. I mean this wan't so bad either, just 19m seems like a lot of money for a mentor. Feel like they could've gone with someone cheaper and worse that could've done just as good a job.

###2018-19

**As part of a 3-team trade, the Sacramento Kings traded George Hill for Iman Shumpert, $2.1M cash and a 2020 2nd round draft pick, Joe Johnson and $1.1M cash (SAC receives MIA 2020 second-round pick from CLE.)**

He lasted one year in Sac and they trade him for a 2nd rounder and some useless pieces. Shumpert got them Alec Burks and a 2nd rounder as well but still kind of useless.

**Drafted Marvin Bagley III in the 1st round (2nd pick) of the 2018 NBA Draft.**

We know how that one turned out. 

**Traded Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph to the Dallas Mavericks for Harrison Barnes.**

Not a bad trade until you consider the contract they gave him after.

###2019-20

**Fired Dave Joerger as Head Coach.**   
**Hired Luke Walton as Head Coach**

Like there's nothing wrong with firing Joerger if there were locker room issues, just hiring Luke Walton without interviewing anyone else is super questionable. He did an awful job in every way possible over in LA and has so far been just as bad in Sac. He slowed the pace down, hired his buddies, and has done nothing to develop the young players. 

**Signed Cory Joseph as a free agent. 37m/3y**   
**Signed Trevor Ariza as a free agent. 25m/2y**   
**Signed Harrison Barnes as a free agent. 85m/4y**   
**Signed Dewayne Dedmon as a free agent. 40m/3y, 26m guaranteed**

Just a bunch of bad contracts all around. He overpaid a bunch of mediocre veterans to do fuck all, two of which he had to dump. The Joseph and Barnes contracts are looking especially bad

**Traded Dewayne Dedmon, a 2020 2nd round draft pick and a 2021 2nd round draft pick to the Atlanta Hawks for Alex Len and Jabari Parker.**

Had to dump Dedmon because he was bad and unhappy. 

**Traded Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan to the Portland Trail Blazers for Kent Bazemore, Anthony Tolliver, a 2024 2nd round draft pick and a 2025 2nd round draft pick.**

Lateral move.

78,LarBrd33,1593631868,9,1,"As the story goes, prior to Game 5 of the 1997 Finals, the Bulls had spent multiple days in Utah.   Given a choice of staying downtown or staying in the ski resort town of Park City, the team chose to stay in Park City.  Steve Kerr is on record as saying that Jordan ended up getting elevation sickness.   Others around the situation have continually claimed that while the team was in Park City for multiple days, Jordan had actually taken a quick 45 minute flight to do some partying in Vegas before returning to Park City in the evening before the game.  This quick Vegas flight was something Jordan was admittedly fond of doing when playing in Utah, but understandably not something anyone within the Bulls organization would want to publicly admit - given the media backlash from Jordan's infamous Atlantic City gambling trip during the 1993 conference finals [directly lead to his first retirement](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/michael-jordan-the-last-dance-gambling-atlantic-city-050420).  

Nonetheless, as supported by multiple accounts, late at night before Game 5, Jordan was in his hotel room playing cards, drinking and smoking cigars when he insisted on ordering some Pizza Hut.   Jordan then proceeded to eat the entire pizza himself.  

So was it altitude sickness?  Was it a hangover?  Was it the fact that one of the greatest athletes of all time had decided to replace his typical diet (consisting mainly of boiled lean chicken breast, nuts and berries) with a greasy stuffed crust pepperoni pizza and caused his body to explode?  Was it some combo of all the above?  

Was it, as Tim Grover suggests, 5 sketchy guys delivering an intentionally ""poisoned pizza""?   Was it just simply a case of everyday ordinary food poisoning, despite the fact that fact every pizza hut ingredient comes pre-cooked and they all go through the same exact conveyor belt oven... and the local Utah Pizza Hut that Jordan ordered from has come out in defense of themselves claiming [the ""poison"" narrative is bullshit](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/michael-jordan-food-poisoning-pizza-hut-story-conspiracy-theory/1076wjdm1k9zi1oqscfgmhgj39)?  

Hard to say... but a mere 43 days after Grover and Jordan threw Pizza Hut under the bus, [Pizza Hut’s largest U.S. franchisee filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/pizza-huts-largest-us-franchisee-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html)

A few of Dr.'s were talking about what a great Rhinoplasty MJ clearly had, somewhere around his 1st NBA season. They were saying with his $$, he could clearly afford the best work. Normal Rhinoplasty is around 10k; top of the line is around 100k, some going up to 500k+. The better the job, the less noticeable it is. One of the Plastic Surgeons also said he thought he had had some chin/jawline/cheekbones work, as well.

I was fucking flabbergasted. Never had even considered it, heard about it. But then I started looking at his nose when he was at N. Carolina, and compared it to his final few seasons on the Bulls, I kinda saw it. It's for sure not the same. Much slimmer down the middle. Different all around shape. After his first contract and endorsements, he for sure could have afforded early '80s state of the art plastic surgery.

During the past 3 months I have found myself watching tons of old games and highlights. I've always been a huge Lebron supporter in a friend group of Bron haters, so my personal debates relied heavily on his success (just saying that to explain my personal biases before my list)

For better or wore, here's my list of most memorable NBA viewing moments

1) games 5, 6, and 7 of the 2016 Finals - I just can't stop rewatching the full games and the highlights. Nothing like that. The improbable comeback. Overcoming that 73 win obstacle. LeBron barking at Curry after throwing his shot...

2) game 6 of the 2013 Finals. Really sticks out as my family was on vacation in a beautiful beach house and I got reprimanded for running thruout the entire house when Ray Allen hit the typing 3. I mean 5 points with under 30 seconds tho..if Manu or Kawhi just made a free throw..

3) Derrick Fisher's.4 second buzzer beater. Really sticks out as one of my first basketball memories, I was pretty young at the time but I remember endlessly acting out buzzer beaters at my goal at home just because of him hitting the shot and running straight out of the arena

4) I don't even remember the game specifically, but I can see the play happening in my head. It's the big 3 celtics vs LeBron still on the Cavs, Rondo is on a fast break and Bron comes flying in for a classic chase down block...except Rondo hits him with a behind the back sweet pass to a trailing teammate who jams it. Really made passing fun for me after seeing youtubing Rondo's ball fakes after that

5) malace at the palace - I don't really need to expand on this but I remember rewatching the ending of this game what seems like hundreds of times. Obviously a travesty, but I loved how intense and violent it was. Never listened to anybody try to tell me basketball isn't a contact sport again.

Hes a finesse type player but theres roo many times that mismatches that shouldnt be able to guard him end up guarding him pretty well because they have the strength to keep AD from getting to the basket. He often resorts to fadaways when he cant get in a good position which hes decent at but not elite. 

Speaking of which he needs to take less fadaways and become more efficient with them at the same time. Maybe develop a Dirk package but dont rely on them as much. If he shot let's say %50 on fadaways with 5-7 attempts per game hes be unguardable. He also needs to improve his 3 point shooting to %35-%37. I think hes definitely capable but hes not confident enough. 

His defense is elite of course but it could still be better he could be the undisputed best defender in the league if he was stronger and better on the perimeter.

Christain Wood played like an All Star last season and will continue to get better. He will be the new starting Center. Luke Kennard was averaging 15 ppg with 40% 3p before getting injured last year. Hes gonna come back with fire. Dr Doom will still be developing but he will be a lot better for his sophomore season. The pistons will be a good next year since they cant trade Blake just yet. There gonna win 51 games. Get the 4th or 3rd seed in the east. 

Even if the season is shorter and they cant make it to 51 they will still be 3rd seed. The NBA doesnt know it, but Lamelo Ball will make the pistons a power house in the eastern conference.

We have an open window because we got lucky and most of the toughest part of the regular season was cut but everyone but Westbrook was tired after 2 months of small ball. Hell, even Tucker got on live and said he didn’t think it was viable for too long. 

Our team is probably a lot more equipped to handle it for a longer period due to the training they’ve been doing but even then the most games that can be played this season is 34 so we have to sweep 1 or 2 ppl or I feel like we’re done. 

That being said, even though I feel Morey and MDA vastly overestimated our thick team could play small, they had nor have any intention to do this again next year, this was a move to catch the league off guard and *potentially* win now and experiment with ways to maximize everyone’s potential. 

If and only if Tillman is wiling to dip into the Tax is my feeling correct. If he is then that means the most likely scenario is to sign Baynes or Ibaka but that can only be done with a competitive offer. If they land either player that means Skinny Harden will have a center on the court with him and Westbrook will most likely play small with 3&amp;D Wings and a guard when they stagger the minutes of the duo. 

With a center that gives them many more options late game when a team has a good big (Philly, LA, LA, Dallas, Milwaukee, Denver). Depending on the situation, the two most likely closing lineups would be: Westbrook/Harden/Tucker/Roco/Ibaka or Westbrook/Harden/Gordon/Roco/Tucker.

&gt; Former NBA player Daniel Orton learned a lesson that many boxers have been taught in the past: You may land a shot on Manny Pacquiao, but you'll likely lose eventually.

&gt; Orton, a 6-foot-10 center, was fined and released from the Purefoods Star Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association late last week after chiding Pacquiao's basketball ability after a game.

&gt; The 5-foot-6 Pacquiao, who has a May 2 fight scheduled against Floyd Mayweather and is also a congressman in the Philippines, has been a player-coach for the Kia Carnival this season and scored one point in the victory against the Hotshots.

&gt;""[Pacquiao playing] is a joke,"" said Orton, who was the Hotshots' designated foreign player. ""... Professional boxer? Yeah. Congressman? All right. But professional basketball player? Seriously? It's a joke.""

&gt; Orton, a 24-year-old Kentucky product who played for the NBA's Magic, Thunder and 76ers from 2011 to 2014, was ultimately let go by the Hotshots after just three games and then fined $5,650 for his comments.

&gt; ""Everyone is angry at him,"" Hotshots top administrator Rene Pardo told Philippine reporters. ""It is like he went to the United States and insulted the name of Martin Luther King.""

&gt; Pacquiao has scored just one point in four games this season.

&gt; PBA commissioner Chito Salud also issued a statement taking issue with Orton's statements about Pacquiao.

&gt; ""This office disapproves of and frowns upon the cavalier manner in which Mr. Orton issued his comments and the unwarranted antics and liberties he has taken with the league and a fellow player,"" Salud's statement said. ""This insulting behavior will never be condoned by the league.""",nba,"About four and a half years ago, former NBA player Daniel Orton was released from his PBA team and essentially kicked out of the league for insulting Manny Pacquiao."

This isn’t a completely original idea (you can find other articles and posts online) but i wanted to be a little more in depth with it. I probable missed some players and had many typos, but please bear with me.  



**AQUARIUS**  
**Team Rank: 12**  

Coach: Gregg Popovich  
PG: Coby White  
SG: Klay Thompson  
SF: Dillon Brooks  
PF: Paul Millsap  
C: Marc Gasol  
6th Man: Montrezl Harrell  
Bench: Donte Divencenzo, Tyler Herro, Terrence Ross, Andre Igoudala  
Reserves: Isaiah Thomas, Maxi Kleber, Kevon Looney  

Aquarii (yes i made that up) are supposed to be the most intelligent of the signs, and are known for being visionaries (probably why the sign makes better coaches than players). They are cold and unpredictable characters (describes Popovich very well). The team here lacks firepower, with Klay Thompson being the only player that would be considered a star in today’s NBA, and he’s also coming off a serious injury. They also lack primary ball handlers, above average perimeter defenders (excluding Thompson), and playmaking compared to other teams in the “league”. They do have shooting on their side with Brooks, Thompson, and Herro all being great around the perimeter. Their X Factor, however is Gregg Popovich as their coach, arguably a top 3 coach of all time  



**GEMINI**  
**Team Rank: 11**  

Coach: Billy Donovan  
PG: Jrue Holiday  
SG: Norman Powell  
SF: Harrison Barnes  
PF: Lauri Markkanen  
C: Al Horford  
6th Man: Jordan Clarkson  
Bench: Markelle Fultz,Carmelo Anthony, Hassan Whiteside, Otto Porter  
Reserves: Danuel House, Deanthony Melton, Willy Hernangomez  

Geminis are known for quick-witted thinking, kindness, and being slightly crazy. This team doesn’t really reflect this with every player here having a relatively calm demeanor (except Hassan of course). This team obviously lacks a bonafide star, and they settle for some above average starters. Painfully average, actually, with Jrue Holiday and Harrison Barnes being the same players they were 3 years ago, and Lauri and Horford both regressing this season. Norman Powell may be the X-factor in the starting lineup, as he was the only one to have an impressive season. Markelle and Carmelo on the bench is... interesting, while Whiteside (the king of empty statlines) and Otto Porter continue the trend of mediocrity. Although this isn’t the worst team, this may be the least interesting.  


**LIBRA**  
**Team Rank: 10**  

Coach: Doc Rivers (or Steve Kerr i guess)  
PG: Derrick Rose  
SG: Rodney Hood  
SF: Kevin Durant  
PF: John Collins  
C: Richaun Holmes  
6th Man: Christian Wood  
Bench: Ricky Rubio, Cody Zeller, Jonathan Isaac, Mike Conley, Joe Ingles  
Reserves: Juan Hernangomez, Shake Milton, Wesley Matthews  

Libras are well balanced people, that value self betterment and compromise, and are open minded but also hold grudges occasionally. Team Libra is headed by a well balanced offensive player named Kevin Durant, although coming off an injury. That is a theme for this team actually, with many of the players being injury prone including Derrick Rose, Rodney Hood, and Jonathan Isaac. But other than that, the team isn’t very exciting, besides the two breakout big men Richaun Holmes &amp; Christian Wood. Mike Conley, Wesley Matthews, and Ricard Rubio have all come off underwhelming seasons, and don’t seem to be on an upward career trajectory. This all leads to a team that has a lot of “ifs”, and puts them in the bottom half of the “league”.  



**CAPRICORN**  
**Team Rank: 9**  

Coach: Mike Malone  
PG: Lebron James (idk maybe)  
SG: Eric Gordon  
SF: Will Barton  
PF: Larry Nance  
C: Javale Mcgee  
6th Man: Rondae Hollis Jefferson  
Bench: Collin Sexton, Doug Mcdermott, Chris Boucher, Gorgui Dieng, Glenn Robinson  
Reserves: Pat Connaughton, Gary Trent, Jordan Bell  

Capricorns are persistent workaholics, slightly sensitive (i didn’t say it) and super ambitious. These could all characterize a certain player on the team (Gorgui Dieng of course). This team is easily one of the weaker teams, when it comes to Larry Nance Jr starting, to Jordan Bell even making the team at all. Lackluster overall, ...but then there’s the King. It’s almost comparable to Lebron’s supporting cast that he hefted on his shoulders and carried to Finals in the 17/18 season. But you have to remember that Lebron... well is kinda good. Eric Gordon and Will Barton, while not super consistent show flashes of greatness once in a while, and RHJ and Boucher have been steals for the Raptors off the bench this year. Collin Sexton is playing the position i believe he should in real life, as a bucket getter off the bench. They might struggle from lack of very consistent 3 point shooting but you have to believe that with Lebron, this team can pull something off, right?  



**LEO**  
**Team Rank: 8**  

Coach: Nick Nurse  
PG: Ja Morant  
SG: Khris Middleton  
SF: Demar Derozan  
PF: Kristaps Porzingis  
C: Deandre Ayton  
6th Man: Danilo Gallinari  
Bench: Andre Drummond, Kendrick Nunn, Kyle Kuzma, Bogdan Bogdanovic, Rudy Gay  
Reserves: Furkan Korkmaz, Patty Mills, Demarcus Cousins  

Leo’s are natural born leaders, sometimes overly dramatic and over confident (explains Kuzma’s hairstyle choices). They are passionate and vivacious and sometimes egotistical. This team really doesn’t echo these characteristics, but it does offer an interesting combination of players. 2 of the best midrange shooters in the NBA take both of the wing positions, while maybe the most exciting point guard playing right now has both Porzingis and Ayton at his disposal. Gallinari, Nunn, and Bogdanovic offer consistent scoring off the bench, while Andre Drummond and Kyle Kuzma are both wild cards. A supposedly healthy Demarcus Cousins makes the reserves, and Nick Nurse should be able to use his defensive magic to cover up any lapses. Though not the craziest team it should be able to hold its own.  


**ARIES**  
**Team Rank: 7**  

Coach: Dwayne Casey  
PG: Kyrie Irving  
SG: Kyle Lowry  
SF: Gordon Hayward  
PF: Pascal Siakam  
C: Brook Lopez  
6th Man: Spencer Dinwiddie  
Bench: Bojan Bogdanovic, Myles Turner, Frank Kaminsky, Justin Holiday  
Reserves: TJ McConnell, Dario Saric, Mitchell Robinson  

Aries are great leaders (Kyrie???), and are characterized by boldness and audaciousness (Now that makes more sense). Super passionate and optomistic, Aries think after they say things, and are prone to pick trial and error over super calculated moves. Led by the dribble god himself, Kyrie Irving, Team Aries has a solid supporting cast, led by Raptors teammates Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry (aka Mr Thickums), who both bring defense and unique ways of scoring. The team’s interior defense is stellar, having Siakam, Myles Turner, Brook Lopez, and Mitchell Robinson all available to protect the rim. There are also proven scoring options off the bench, and although not being super deep there’s no reason to doubt the role players (except maybe Kaminsky). This all brings the team being projected for the middle of the pack.  

**TAURUS**  
**Team Rank: 6**  

Coach: Mike D’Antoni  
PG: Kemba Walker  
SG: Victor Oladipo  
SF: Paul George  
PF: Domantas Sabonis  
C: Jarrett Allen  
6th Man: Chris Paul  
Bench: George Hill, Duncan Robinson, Clint Capela, PJ Tucker, Jonas Valanciunas  
Reserves: Terence Davis, Dorian Finley Smith, Ersan Ilyasova  

Taurus people are known to tow the line between determination and stubbornness. Also known as Taureans (Taurean Prince is a Aries ???), they are known to have strong opinions, don’t like to be pushed, and will do anything to win an argument, or a basketball game (don’t you dare untuck your jersey). The Taurus Team are led by a 1-2 Punch of Kemba Walker and Paul George, with solid big men both starting and coming off the bench, bolstering the paint. They have some of the best D’Antoni type role players in the game in Hill, Tucker, and Robinson, but the X Factor for this team is Chris Paul leading the second string, and maybe giving the team a 2 point guard option. This team looks like a fun team to watch, but nothing crazy compared to the rest of the teams.  

**SAGITTARIUS**  
**Team Rank: 5**  

Coach: Terry Stotts  
PG: DeAaron Fox  
SG: Buddy Hield  
SF: Kelly Oubre  
PF: Robert Covington  
C: Giannis Antetokoumpo  
6th Man: Eric Bledsoe  
Bench: Malcolm Brogdon, Malik Beasley, Dwight Howard, Julius Randle, Aron Baynes  
Reserves: Dion Waiters, Grant Williams, Avery Bradley, Deandre Hunter  

Sagittarius people are honest, optimistic, and independent people, and along with having the most vague characteristics, they have one of the more interesting teams in the “league”. Led by the Greek Freak, (who i believe can do a great job at the 5 spot), he is surrounded by trusted shooters like Hield, Covington, and Beasley, and has extra ball handlers like Fox and Bledsoe take control when he isn’t running the offense. They have big men like the GOAT Aron Baynes, a revamped Dwight Howard, and the human Beyblade that is Julius Randle at their disposal on the bench. This team, while not being super flashy, could be a sleeper candidate for a top 3 spot at best.  

**SCORPIO**  
**Team Rank: 4**  

Coach: Erik Spoelstra  
PG: Russell Westbrook  
SG: Devin Booker  
SF: Jaylen Brown  
PF: Davis Bertans  
C: Karl Anthony Towns  
6th Man: Lou Williams  
Bench: Lonzo Ball, Evan Fournier, Nikola Vucevic, Zach Collins, Tomas Satoransky  
Reserves: Patrick McCaw, Tony Snell, Eric Paschall  

Scorpios are the most hated zodiac sign, by experience (OP has felt the hatred personally), due to their tendency to do anything for success, bypassing ethics and rationale (ask Patrick McCaw supposedly). They are tough, honest, resentful, and loyal. These all may describe the point guard of this team, Russell Westbrook, who has an amazing team to support him, with a surplus of 3 point shooting with KAT, Devin Booker, Jaylen Brown, and Bertans all being able to shoot the lights out. Arguably the best 6th man of all time is at work again, while Lonzo Ball also has passing options as Nikola Vucevic and Fournier are both solid players. The reason this team can’t be considered top 3 is due to the depth other teams have. Therefore #4 is perfect.  

**VIRGO**  
**Team Rank: 3**  

Coach: Steve Clifford  
PG: James Harden    
SG: Donovan Mitchell  
SF: Jimmy Butler  
PF: Brandon Ingram  
C: Kevin Love  
6th Man: Trae Young  
Bench: CJ McCollum, TJ Warren, Jaren Jackson Jr, Serge Ibaka, Dennis Schroder  
Reserves: Marcus Morris, Seth Curry, Aaron Gordon, Jusuf Nurkic  

Virgos are practical perfectionists who value diligent work and practice, and maybe are critical of themselves and their colleagues (better be in the gym by 3:30). This team is well balanced with Harden and Mitchell bringing a massive amount of offense in the back court, and Jimmy Butler bringing ball handling and defense, rounding out the “Big 3”. Trae Young as a 6th man maybe the X Factor for this team, however as he leads a strong 2nd unit including shooters like CJ Mccollum and TJ Warren, and stretch bigs like Ibaka and JJJ. The main problem will be getting evereybody touches, as there are so many iso players on one team, and they just aren’t as good on the defensive side as the other two above them, therefore they get the 3rd spot  

**CANCER**  
**Team Rank: 2**  

Coach: Frank Vogel  
PG: Damian Lillard  
SG: Bradley Beal  
SF: Kawhi Leonard  
PF: Tobias Harris  
C: Rudy Gobert  
6th Man: Ben Simmons  
Bench: SGA (spelled his name wrong 6 times), Zion Williamson, Bam Adebayo, OG Anunoby, Lamarcus Aldridge  
Reserves: Michael Porter Jr., Patrick Beverly, Danny Green  

Cancers are tenacious yet quiet people, known to be loyal (Kawhi???) sympathetic, emotional (Kawhi???), and slightly goofy. Their team echoes the quiet yet tenacious theme, and they have one of the best rosters to come from the experiment. The back court of Beal and Lillard offers a shooting barrage and the front court has a two of the best defenders in the league, Kawhi and Gobert. It doesn’t stop there however, as the 2nd string lineup might be as scary as the first. Bam and Ben off the bench maybe the tallest playmaking duo ever, and not to mention Zion being thrown halfcourt lobs by both of them. SGA and Aldridge round out the bench, with the player with the completely opposite characteristics of his teammates (Patrick Beverly) on the reserves. This team could easily be number one, however they miss out on the top spot due to the sheer star power of the Pisces team.  


**PISCES**  
**Team Rank: 1**  

Coach: JB Bickerstaff  
PG: Stephen Curry  
SG: Marcus Smart  
SF: Luka Doncic  
PF: Anthony Davis  
C: Joel Embiid  
6th Man: Jayson Tatum  
Bench: Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, Zach Lavine, D’Angelo Russell, Draymond Green  
Reserves: Andrew Wiggins, Fredward Van Vleet, Matisse Thybulle  

Pisces are creative, crafty and somewhat laid back humans. The creativeness shines through ballers like Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, and Nikola Jokic, who wow fans and frustrate opponents with clever moves. This inexplicably stacked team also features some amazing guards off the bench, and pillars of defensive prowess. Imagining Steph Curry and Luka Doncic throwing lobs to not just AD, but Embiid is enough to make any man’s loins tremble, Easily the best team in the “league” you have to wonder if every hooper born between February 19th and March 20th has head start on his peers? (Anthony Bennett would hastily disprove this theory). These players are so good that you can ignore that they are being coached by someone with 39% winning percentage. Therefore this team deserves the top spot.",nba,THE ZODIAC LEAGUE: Which Zodiac Sign Would have the Best Current NBA Team?

“There’s a story going around that the owner of the Brooklyn Nets is looking to make a ‘Godfather offer’ to Gregg Popovich, and when I say the Godfather, I mean ‘something he can’t refuse” Brown

Rumor was strong enough to elicit a response from Sean Marks, who attempted to shoot it down.

However, it’s hard to picture Popovich leaving the River City. He’s planted his roots in San Antonio and most people move out of New York City after they hit retirement age, not into it. That’d be a massive undertaking for someone whose been speculated to retire more often than he’s been to change teams in the last 10 years. With that said, coaching those two guys with a chance for one last ring could be enticing enough to draw Coach Pop to Brooklyn for a year.

Griffin has been a great player, super athletic, unstoppable in the paint but the moment he couldn't use his athletism at 100%, despite making incredible improvements in shooting and ballhandling his impact regressed year after year.

Now I'm thinking at 19 years Zion (now 20), already a season barely played because of a knee injury (blake missed his whole rookie season for an injury) and a game almost totally build on his athletism.

Zion is 6'6 (Griffin is 6'10) with a great wingspan but a pretty short standing reach (as high as Klay thompson) so I'm wondering if he's at risk to see his impact drastically dropped in case of some injury here and there, no need to a major one ala Rose. How would cope with being forced to play without his athleticism in full display?

Let's be clear: every player in this league would struggle if his athleticism get worse but not all players are their style of play build mostly on athleticism.

Zion would need to became a damn good shooter and work more outside the paint, because without the ability to jump over 7 footers ain't gonna be the same for him.

So the idea is that Griffin has been so close to be superstar but even while being in full force he never reached that stardom.

When talking about Kidd being hired to coach the Nets in 2013, Kyrie had this to say while raving about him:

&gt; “His IQ. Just watching the way he plays the game. Not many people have that niche and that feel for the game,” Irving told the New York Post’s Fred Kerber after Kidd was hired as Nets coach in 2013.

Marks also said he was going to consult Kyrie and KD about who they want as coach, and I'm sure Kidd will be at least mentioned and Kyrie is gonna have a say. Ty Lue and Vaughn are also obviously considerations, but I think this could be a big deal for Kidd getting the job.

Obviously the NBA bubble situation is more robust but it's certainly nowhere near 100% protected. One player infected on a contending team could start a chain reaction to derail this whole experiment.

Disney Union protocols and logistical challenges make it difficult to keep hospitality workers bubbled, but is it impossible? It seems time to explore all options because money and safety are at stake and an outbreak at Disney would be much worse than spending extra money and changing union protocols.

Cruise ship style staffing for all hospitality workers at the NBA site. One month deals no in and out privileges, no visitors. Those who accept get triple pay. Those who decline stay home with full pay and get replaced.

In today’s NBA as we all know the ability to shoot and space the floor is key to being THE winning team amongst multitudes of other required abilities and Bertans ability to shoot a very high volume of threes and making a good amount of them (3.7 3P on 8.7 3PA) is something teams will fight to get.

I think that there is a good case for Washington Wizards to re-sign their starting PF if they offer a good enough price, after all Davis is a family man and how much his family enjoy Washington could heavily impact his decision in free agency.

You could also make a case that Davis believes with Wall coming back Wizards could become a playoff team which based on Walls,Beals and Bertans offensive poweress while on other teams he’d become a 6man.

On the other hand if Davis is happy with a bench role playing on a playoff team is very lucrative, only of course if they offer him the check that is reflective of the tools he brings to the team.

I’d say that Davis is looking at 12-17 million contract per year with the higher end cash stack coming from the Wizards if they decide to match him.

I can see Bucks,Nets,Jazz,Rockets or Nuggets trying to get Davis to play for their team one way or another.

Clippers Recieve: Joel Embiid,Raul Neto,Mike Scott

76ers recieve: Paul George,Landry Shamet,Ivica Zubac, A second round pick in 2023 via Atlanta, A second round pick in 2022 via detroit

If the sixers get bounced in round 1 they might consider to trade Embiid and I think this trade is really good. They get Paul George who is a far better fit with Simmons and can make them legit title contenders. They also get back Landry Shamet who is a absolute sniper from downtown and can be a good 6 man and he is still young and has potential. They also get back Zubac who is a nice young big man and also 2 second rounders from bad teams which have a chance to be in the 30-40 range which are pretty solid picks. As for the clippers they always have lacked a big that can handle other bigs in the west and Joel Embiid would be perfect for that. He is 4 years younger extending their window to win and would be a great fit with Kawhi

The sixers would have a closing lineup of: Simmons-George-Richardson-Harris-Horford

The clippers would have a closing lineup of: Beverley-Williams-Leonard-Harrell-Embiid

Secondly, there's a possibility of a general decline in interest in the NBA after this. People have just went months without Sports, there's a chance that people won't be as interested when Sports return. Especially with all the Political Polarization we have now in this country.

Russ's best scoring game of 45 points on 59.3% FG against Minnesota was with Capela playing 34 mins.

Additional accomplishments include six shots in .98 seconds with a Barrett M107 .50 BMG rifle and a 1000-yard shot off hand with his signature 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.",nba,Steph Curry is NOT the greatest shooter of all time

Lockout seasons don’t really make a difference in my opinion, but i think that injuries do. For example, the Raptors would have probably been beaten if not for injuries to KD and Klay. That doesn’t warrant an asterisk though, it’s just another point for fans to discuss. 

Coronavirus makes this more interesting because a player can effectively be “injured” by catching the virus. Even so, it’d be hard to place an asterisk on this season without several superstars in title contention sitting out due to positive covid tests.

&gt;“What do you do now,” Rivers asked the former chief executive of Microsoft, “other than own the Clippers?”

&gt;“His answer was incredibly simple, but shocking,” Rivers recently recalled. “He said, ‘I give money away.’ It made me sit up, like, well, pardon me?”

&gt;The money went to education, Ballmer told him. That led to the topic of inequity in schools, which led to racial injustices felt nationwide. Helping find solutions for such systemic issues had become the “life’s work” for Ballmer and his wife, Connie, Rivers was told.

(...)

&gt;It is a story he often has retold, and not only because it is essentially the origin story of Ballmer Group’s work in L.A., where Revoyr runs its operations. The trip also underscored the “cradle-to-career” view of philanthropy Connie first realized a decade earlier through her philanthropy with foster children in Washington. Affecting lasting change meant not only reforming the foster system, but also child welfare, education, health care and juvenile justice.

&gt;“You kind of have to look at the whole thing, and you’ve got to do it within the community setting to see what’s going on in their world,” Connie said. “And all the way along as we looked at this, it was crystal clear from the beginning that racial inequities were a huge issue.”

711,closed_n,1594250907,10,1,"It's already been mentioned on this subreddit how the 2015-16 Spurs once put Andre Miller, Kevin Martin, Manu Ginobli, David West, and Tim Duncan all on the court at the same time, for a combined age of 185 years or 37 years per person. But with the (relatively) young Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, and LaMarcus Aldridge starting most games for those Spurs, such an old lineup never started any games for that team.

So what are the oldest starting lineups that a team has trotted out onto the court? As an example, the oldest lineup that Spurs team started is this 162-years lineup:

I personally support the idea of the BLM movement, and support that there needs to be a change in the system, especially the police. 

However, I don’t hear any players come into the defense of Asians that are being discriminated against during the first wave of COVID-19, I don’t hear a lot of players speaking up or be enraged about the Anti Semitic post that Desean put out as when they were enraged about Drew Brees (I personally don’t think that kneeling during any national anthem, to protest/bring up a problem in the nation, is a wrong thing to do or disrespect to the flag), and I also don’t hear people speaking up about the annexation of Palestine.

Maria Brenes, the executive director of Boyle Heights-based nonprofit InnerCity Struggle, a past Ballmer Group grant recipient, agreed that those working in the communities should take the lead in generating ideas. But she didn’t doubt Ballmer’s support, saying she witnessed it in person last year. At a meeting of civic and philanthropic leaders discussing Measure EE, the parcel tax that would have generated funding for L.A. schools, Brenes was struck by Ballmer’s show of support.

“He was aligned with us,” Brenes said. “The billionaire with the grassroots.”

&amp;#x200B;

 “They understand it’s not just a check,” Bremond Weaver said. “Your level of commitment is being a part of the story and understanding the story and understanding why the investments need to happen.”

For Brotherhood Crusade, grant money helped increase the size of its operations in 15 South L.A. schools, where a mentorship network aims to divert young men away from the juvenile justice system toward graduation and higher education.

Davon Hunt considers himself one of the program’s success stories. He credited the program’s mentors with helping him address childhood trauma and evolve from a self-described anti-social freshman at Washington Preparatory High into a 2020 graduate who says he now hopes to build his community from within through his own mentoring.

“They really prepared me on how you may have a life plan but other things may come between that, and how to adapt and really push forward,” Hunt said. “It is really changing kids’ lives.”

Most philanthropy organizations direct their funds toward specific issues, or specific regions, said Katherina Rosqueta, the executive director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania. The Ballmers can afford to think big picture, given a wealth that Forbes values at north of $70 billion. As a limited liability company, Ballmer Group can fund a broader array of initiatives than traditional foundations, which are restricted to 501(c)3 nonprofits.

That includes backing advocacy groups who try to help shape state and national policies on criminal justice issues including bail reform and expunging criminal records. Ballmer Group also works from the other direction, regularly talking with lawmakers from legislators in the state of Washington to Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles), in D.C.

“They are looking at all the systems that could, if addressed, lead to better outcomes, and those systems are not just with specific nonprofits,” Rosqueta said. “It could be funding in the way that government works, and that may also be in the ways that the business sector can contribute.

”... That’s just a way of thinking of how to deploy philanthropy which is consistent with how we view high-impact philanthropy.”

Their areas of interest could continue to broaden. The Ballmers said they have yet to dig in deeply on transportation, housing and policing, though their group has funded some community policing initiatives and Steve Ballmer said he supports calls for police reform.

As L.A. outsiders, Connie Ballmer said they understood if there was skepticism about their goals. The couple stressed that they’ve never claimed to be experts, only listeners.

“Some people can donate, some people can give their time, some people can give — whether it’s volunteering in the social service agency, whether it is volunteering for an advocacy organization, whether it’s getting out the vote, whether it is voting,” Steve Ballmer said.

“We all need to learn from each other, but it should be grounded in kind of how the communities work and what community leaders in the not‑for‑profits and the advocacy organizations are pushing for.”",nba,"[Greif] Steve and Connie Ballmer have donated over $300 million in the last 3 years to fund the work of more than 70 non profits working in the communities of color in Detroit, Seattle, and LA.

723,Bharper00,1594249577,0,1,"I doubt anyone sees this but I have to get this out. I am so happy to see what I have from this community after what has come about from DeSean Jackson on Twitter. I honestly thought there would be more memes and strong takes on his side due to the anonymity of reddit.

As a Jew, I have faced persecution on many occasions  in my daily life and seeing it come up from people that some consider role models was heartbreaking today. It especially hurt to see no one vocally stand up for our community like they have for the BLM movement. I do support the BLM entirely but seeing how many at the forefront of one movement support the bashing of another minority while other leaders stay quiet is puzzling.

Matthew Berry’s comments, along with others such as Chris Long (goat post on his Instagram btw if you want to listen) and others, have been shared in insane amounts, so I won’t rehash them. I do want to highlight Ray Allen’s article from 2017 though. It is a worthwhile read for those that haven’t read it or are not fully understanding the fuss around this whole situation.

Worth noting that I do not think DeSean Jackson should get cut. Something has to happen though, but at the very least I do hope he gets educated on why what he posted is truly hurtful as it still doesn’t seem like he gets it. Education is key. It worked for Tim Hardaway and I hope the same healthy outcome can happen here. Also, I hope he takes up the holocaust survivor on his offer when the quarantine and travel ban get lifted. Same can be said about his teammate Goodwin. 

I do want to end on one idea though, a fight against anti-semitism isn’t a fight against BLM. I don’t know why some thing that it takes away. We should support the rights of all prosecuted groups.

This sub since it's a sports sub, pays a lot of attention /places importance to what athletes say. While they have a unique platform falsely associating their voice of power with a meaningful voice only aims to preserve violence in the status quo, which is one where innocent black lives are brutally murdered by police officers.


 I've seen a lot of posts saying something along the lines of DeSean, Stephen Jackson are undermining the movement. NO THEY AREN'T!! there are  intelligent things said by Ray Allen and other athletes. 

What DeSean and Stephen said are despicable and needs to be addressed in a very upfront manner, but saying it undermines BLM is an association fallacy.

The same goes for a player drafted in 2012 playing in 2030. Anthony Davis was drafted in 2012. He will most likely be washed up in 2030 because 18 years will do that to you. 

Look at Rajon Rondo, although hes still okay he was drafted in 2006 and started becoming washed up in 2019 so that was 12 years of good quality basketball. Jamal Crawford was drafted in 2000 and is still an okay player. But he started his washed up process in 2017 when his stats started to dip. 

It's very interesting to look at this. A player drafted in 2014 has a lot of value in 2020 bc he is still young. Maybe, around the 25-28 area still pretty young. But in the year 2026 a lot of players from 2014 will be washed, or wont even have a job in the league. The same can go for a player drafted in 2008 playing in 2020. Theres still a couple good players out there like Danilo Gallinari from 2008. Goran Dragic is good, Surge Ibaka is good but a lot of players from 2008 have already retired. Or are just riding the bench bc they arent as good as they used to be. 

We can even go into the future a little bit here. A lot players from the 2020 nba draft will not make it to the 2032 season. Some will, but a lot of the ones who went to college for 4 years will be out of the league. Bc at that point you are already gonna turn 34 and that is a prime age for the washed up process to start.

Like can we please put legacies aside for a second, because that’s not even what we’re discussing here. Just look at Kawhi’s 2019 run next to Kobe’s 2009. Then tell me what’s so ridiculous:

19 Kawhi (24 games): 30.5/9.1/3.9, .490/.379/.884 (+16.8 on/off)

That year the Suns were the #1 offense and revolutionized offensive basketball. 

In 2005-2006, the Suns lost Amare Stoudemire(their second best player)for most of the season, and many thought the Suns would be an average playoff team (40-45 wins). However, they ended up with 57 wins and second in the West while Nash averaged 18.8 ppg and 10.5 apg on 53/46/92 shooting splits(63 TS%).

Performances in which he clearly wasn’t the best player on the team, are being rewritten in the concept of being guarded more or ‘gravity’ (which is Completely overstated, I’ll explain down below). 

Any bad Curry performance is just excused due to Gravity &amp; being ‘guarded’ more....despite Curry leading the post season in open shots year after year. A teammate outplays Curry, “He only was successful because of Curry”.

To me, it’s a bit questionable when people have to start resorting to gravity to talk about a superstars performance. Every star has gravity. It’s like certain Steph fans will argue curry outplayed KD despite the eye test and every metric disagreeing. And their justification is always immeasurable qualities.

This is very popular in the Finals regarding the MVP. 

According to stats.nba.com :

% of shots that were open (no defender within 4 feet), 2017 Finals

Curry - 48.4%
KD - 27.8%


You can’t be the most guarded player on the court on while simultaneously being the most open player (after Klay).....2 open dunks in game 2 that KD got shouldn’t completely shift a narrative....

Furthermore, Curry’s TS dropped from 65 TS to 59 TS with KD off the floor....why is KDs massive impact on Stephs efficiency never mentioned in this sub? Also, If Curry is the player being heavily guarded, Why does he suffer that much of a drop off without KD? It’s almost like KD sees just as much of defensive schemes.... 


There are maybe 2 or 3 plays a game where a defender bites on a screen getting IGGY an open Dunk but the Vast, Vast, Vast majority of the game is played in the half court With KD isoing on the leagues best defenders.

Why is this narrative being pushed to Make Curry seem better than players he clearly isn’t in the playoffs (KD/Kawhi and even recently Harden)......

Folks also rewrite History in that he deserved the 2018 Finals FMVP because KD was just open all game....

Well, Curry attempted 18 more shots than KD in that series, how is he guarded more yet shoots 18 more shot attempts? 

IMO, Too many Curry fans are putting A lot of weight into immeasurable aspects of the game to elevate curry in places he simply doesn’t belong. For decades, player comparisons have been pretty simple, but with Curry, some fans conveniently choose immeasurable arguments (in the playoffs) to  elevate him. His box score doesn’t measure up? Oh just mention useless terms like gravity (still no rigorous definition), His plus minus stats in the playoffs don’t measure up? Just use a different critters....it’s just never ending.     

Even the plus minus or impact numbers support fans KD in the playoffs.....

Why’s it so hard to accept he’s at best.....the 4th best player this decade in terms of playoff performances?",nba,Is the rhetoric around Currys gravity getting out of hand?

Any player who tests positive for the virus must undergo a ""COVID-19 Pre-Participation Cardiac Screening"" in accordance with CDC protocols before beginning team-organized activities, according to the league's health and safety protocols.

The reason the league and NBPA have focused specifically on the heart is myriad, but, according to a memo to teams on June 15, the basis for cardiac screening during the pandemic is tied to recommendations from the American College of Cardiology's Sports &amp; Exercise Cardiology Council, along with feedback from consulting cardiologists for both teams and those who work with the NBPA and NBA.

""They reflect a current consensus approach, recognizing that the complete clinical picture of COVID-19 and potential effects on cardiac health, including myocarditis in particular, are not yet fully understood, and may be modified in the future to reflect new information,"" the league wrote in the memo.

The recommendations from the American College of Cardiology's Sports &amp; Exercise Cardiology Council note that ""Acute cardiac injury ... occur[s] in up to 22% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 2 which is significantly higher compared with the approximately 1% prevalence in non-COVID-19 acute viral infections.""",nba,"[Holmes] Per recommendations from consulting cardiologists, any player who tests positive for the virus must undergo a ""COVID-19 Pre-Participation Cardiac Screening"" in accordance with CDC protocols before beginning team-organized activities"

933,EGarrett,1594422284,56,1,"Bill Simmons mentioned once on his podcast that he considered Glenn Robinson to be the ""average"" #1 Draft Pick. Meaning that his career was about exactly in the middle of what you'd hope to get out of a #1 pick. Played 11 years, averaged over 20 ppg, made a couple All-Star Teams, was part of an Eastern Conference Finals run in the playoffs. So if your #1 pick does worse than Glenn Robinson, it's a disappointment, and better than that, it's a success.

So who should be the average #2 pick? [Here's a list for convenience.](http://www.basketballinsiders.com/history-of-the-nba-draft-by-pick/history-of-the-nba-draft-pick-number-2/) My guess is below.

&gt;!After looking at it myself, I figured the best choice was Mike Bibby. Playing about 13 years, starting-level guard, best year was 19 points and 7 assists per game, didn't make an All-Star team but no one would've complained if he did, had a few big clutch shots, part of a very successful Kings team.

Unfortunately, horrible persons like Louis Farrakhan are somehow popular (especially among NBA players...) and because we all use the word  “education“ today, I wanted to break down some antisemitic myths for those who believe in it.

First of all, [here is](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/reports/nation-of-islam-farrakhan-in-his-own-words) an article showing how horrible Louis Farrakhan is and the disgusting things he said. 

Now, for people who really believes that Jews are behind slavery, here is the truth. Everything comes from[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_slavery), with sources. 

“A historian of slavery, describes the part of Jews in slave trading in the southern United States as ""minuscule"", and writes that the historical rise and fall of slavery in the United States would not have been affected at all had there been no Jews living in the American South.Jews accounted for 1.25% of all Southern slave owners, and were not significantly different from other slave owners in their treatment of slaves.“

“In 1830 there were only four Jews among the 11,000 Southerners who owned fifty or more slaves.“

“ A significant number of Jews gave their energies to the antislavery movement.Many 19th century Jews, such as Adolphe Crémieux, participated in the moral outcry against slavery. In 1849, Crémieux announced the abolition of slavery throughout the French possessions.“

For those who believes all Jews are rich, here is a sad truth: According to 2011 data, 20 percent of individuals in Jewish households in New York lived in a household with an income below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. 30% of Jewish kids in NYC are poor. 

There isn’t different degres of racism and antisemitism, you are or you’re not. Clairly, Stephen Jackson is. Worse, he’s using the same way that racists use to deny it. “I have Jewish friends“, no comment. “I’m not antisemite because I never say I hate Jews“ (him on CNN). Do you think racists say “I hate blacks“? No. But they will say racist stuff like blacks are all criminals. Exactly the same thing for him that said Jews own all of the banks...

&gt;In the letter, Hawley said Silver has been ""deepening the NBA's ties to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]"" since Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong in October.

&gt;Hawley said the league's new policy of ""enhanced employee expression"" when it comes to social injustice has ""crossed the line of sanctioning specific political messages"" rather than allow free speech.

&gt;""This is a time for you to make clear what your league believes about human rights and about the nation that is your home,"" Hawley wrote.

&gt;NBA executive vice president of communications Mike Bass told ESPN: ""We just received the letter and are reviewing it.""

&gt;In response to the senator's letter, ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski replied with a profane email. The senator posted Wojnarowski's reply on his social media account.

&gt;""I was disrespectful and I made a regrettable mistake,"" Wojnarowski said in an apology. ""I'm sorry for the way I handled myself and I am reaching out immediately to Senator Hawley to apologize directly. I also need to apologize to my ESPN colleagues because I know my actions were unacceptable and should not reflect on any of them.""

&gt;ESPN also issued a statement, which said: ""This is completely unacceptable behavior and we do not condone it. It is inexcusable for anyone working for ESPN to respond in the way Adrian did to Senator Hawley. We are addressing it directly with Adrian and specifics of those conversations will remain internal.""

&gt;The list of the suggested messages that were agreed to by the NBPA and the NBA and then made available to players via email, per the source, are: Black Lives Matter; Say Their Names; Vote; I Can't Breathe; Justice; Peace; Equality; Freedom; Enough; Power to the People; Justice Now; Say Her Name; Sí Se Puede (Yes We Can); Liberation; See Us; Hear Us; Respect Us; Love Us; Listen; Listen to Us; Stand Up; Ally; Anti-Racist; I Am a Man; Speak Up; How Many More; Group Economics; Education Reform; and Mentor.

&gt;""The truth is that your decisions about which messages to allow and which to censor -- much like the censorship decisions of the CCP -- are themselves statements about your association's values,"" Hawley wrote to Silver. ""If I am right -- if the NBA is more committed to promoting the CCP's interests than to celebrating its home nation -- your fans deserve to know that is your view.

&gt;""If not, prove me wrong. Let your players stand up for the Uighurs and the people of Hong Kong. Let them stand up for the American law enforcement if they so choose. Give them the choice to write 'Back the Blue' on their jerseys. Or 'Support Our Troops.' Maybe 'God Bless America.' What could be more American than that?""",nba,"U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, in a letter to NBA commissioner Adam Silver on Friday, wrote that the league's policy on social injustice messages ""appears to stop at the edge of your corporate sponsors' sensibilities.”"

992,LarBrd33,1594412718,11,1,"I recently got an Oculus Quest.  Pretty rad.  Coming into it with no experience, the social aspect is the part that has blown me away the most.  Apps like VR Chat, Rec Room, Bigscreen, etc where you can actually interact virtually with other people's Avatars. It's far closer to ""Ready Player One"" than I anticipated.  I obviously haven't been able to try watching live sports with it yet.  I'm curious if people have ever tried it and what that experience is like?  Is there any social aspect to it, or do you basically just have a 360 degree camera on the court you can watch through?

I've been thinking about upcoming quarantine games (if they actually happen) and how VR could be a great way to watch with other fans. I don't think the tech is there yet (my guess is latency from real-time would be the biggest challenge), but I was thinking how cool it would be if NBA fans were able to watch these games in a virtual arena.  They could cheer alongside other people's avatars.  The next level would be setting up screens in the actual physical arena so that they players could see and hear fans cheering/booing while they were playing.   I don't think we're at that point yet, though.  Again, I suspect that latency would be the biggest issue.  Player scores and they don't see the fan reaction for a couple seconds later.

Putting aside that concept...  [""Bigscreen""](https://www.bigscreenvr.com/) seems like it would be a cool way to watch games together with people during this lockdown era.  Bigscreen is an app that basically has all these different virtual rooms (fancy living room, movie theater, outdoor patio, etc) where you can sit around with people virtually watching whatever video/streaming content the room host shares from their desktop.  I'm a Celtic fan, but I'm hoping to try getting some fellow fans together to watch some of these games (if they happen).  Anyone ever tried using Bigscreen for that purpose?  Mainly I'm curious how large the crossover is between NBA fans and VR enthusiasts... maybe it's tiny.  If it's big enough maybe it's worthwhile to have team-specific private rooms where folks can gather virtually and root for their teams together.

**TL;DR:  Just some random thoughts about watching NBA games with fans in virtual reality**",nba,NBA Games in VR?

1003,dkbexxx,1594511476,11,1,"Hi All,

Woj needing to apologize to ESPN after his epic email response got me thinking.... why is Woj working for a network at this point in his career? Is he big enough in NBA circles that he could leave ESPN and start his own revenue generation machine without losing any reporting capabilities? Is it possible that in starting up his own shop, he can actually *enhance* his delivered product?  I can't help but think of Bill Simmons here - and I know they're different types of reporters - but what Bill has been able to accomplish after leaving ESPN is impressive. Starting your own your platform can be incredibly lucrative.

I'm not suggesting that Woj should leave ESPN, or if that is even a good idea given his type of content. Obviously ESPN is huge and has hundreds of paid reporters and information sourcers, so if Woj left, he'd certainly be leaving behind some levers and pulleys. In this thought experiment, though, I'm wondering how resource-intensive it would be for Woj to build a \[new\] profitable content hub.

Essentially, I'm asking, what is the barrier to entry for Woj here? 

In terms of constraints, lets say he is capable of raising 10-20M in a seed round and can also pluck a few (4-5) A-list reporters from ESPN, The Athletic, Yahoo Sports, etc.... and they can immediately leave their respective networks without any non-compete issues.

Even in interviews, it’s Kyrie very clearly tries to posture himself and speak like aN older Kobe, to the point where it’s almost a little cringe inducing. Yet while Kyrie has a very promising start to his career up until winning the most historic championship in recent memory, ever since then he’s been on a bit of a downward spiral, both in terms of his public image and even his game. (The lasser mostly due to injury). 

Ironically, this actually makes him more similar to Kobe than some might think, as Kobe also had a rocky middle part to his NBA career. So far their journeys are rather similar. Both were young and promising talents, won championship(s) contributing major contributions but overshadowed by a more popular athletes, then had a falling out and media speculation ran wild about their attitudes. Obviously, the major difference here is Kyrie has switched teams twice whereas Kobe stayed a Laker forever. But now that Kyrie is on Brooklyn with KD, desperate for a fresh start, how do you guys think he can approach things to really enhance his legacy?

I’m mainly asking this because I’m a Warriors fan, and what he did to us in 2016 was extremely painful but also incredibly mesmerizing. In the last three games of those finals he seemed unstoppable. Though Lebron was statistically dominating the series and did deserve FMVP, purely from an optics standpoint, I would have given the FMVP to Kyrie. And though now he’s kind of in the fringes of the best PG discussion, in that moment I thought he’s a 1B to Stephen Curry’s 1A as the best point guard in the league. He had a ton of potential to be an all time great and I think that momentum has really wavered off, partially due to his own fault and partially due to external factors outside of his control.

Now, lets go with the younger guys (for fun)

Giannis. He has one MVP and is winning another one this year. That's two MVPs by age 25. He needs to start winning championships though. Although a Top 3 favorite this year, it looks like most people put them at #3 behind the Lakers and Clippers. Also, his team is getting older. 

AD. I heard multiple say and talk about how, based on talent, he may be the best PF ever. If the Lakers can wing a ring or two with him &amp; LeBron and then AD takes over the team and wins a few, he could surpass TD.

It would probably take some sort of draft assets but the 76ers actually have a ton of those and I don't imagine it taking more than 1 first rounder and maybe a couple seconds.

1110,husam-hanieh,1594596442,16,1,"As we wind down this tumultuous regular season, regular season awards talks are bound to ramp up. Prior to the season's hiatus, many were of the opinion that LeBron had closed the gap in the MVP race because of the Lakers' victories of the Bucks and Clippers. 

A lot of people, such as myself, thought it was ridiculous but before I could even blink, the narrative started to shift and all of a sudden, people began to make it seem like it was a close, competitive race when just 1 week before the Lakers' victories many were contemplating giving the award to Giannis *unanimously*. 

But alas, some people think that this is a close race. And with all respect to LeBron, it's not. Giannis blows him out of the water defensively and has similar offensive metrics. In terms of impact, it's the same picture being painted for the defensive side. See for yourself down below: 

**Defense**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
DBPM | 4.1 | 1.9
DPIPM | 4.5 | 1.9
D-RAPTOR | 4.0 | 1.1
DRPM | 2.7 | 1.9
DRTG | 96.5 | 103.0
DWS | 4.8 | 3.4
On-Off | -7.7 | -3.6

Defensivley, it's not even close. In every imaginable advanced defensive metric, Giannis emerges victoriously. There isn't a single defensive metric I could find that LeBron has the lead in. 

Giannis thoroughly dominates LeBron in this regard and almost none of their respective metrics are close. That's not to say LeBron is a bad defender, but Giannis has been historically great this season defensively. 

**Offense**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
OBPM | 7.9 | 6.8
O-PIPM | 4.5 | 4.2
O-RAPTOR | 5.3 | 6.7
ORPM | 7.1 | 6.1 
ORTG | 112.6 | 113.3
OWS | 5.6 | 6.1
On-Off | 4.4 | 8.1

In this regard, LeBron got the slight edge in most of their advanced offensive metrics. Giannis still has him beat in a couple of metrics or at the very least, is within close range. 

Regardless, LeBron gets the edge here. He's been phenomenal this season offensively. He's been the engine running this Lakers offense. However, it's a slight edge and unfortunately it's not enough to make for the universe-sized gap Giannis has on LeBron defensively. 

**Impact**

Statistic | Antetokounmpo | James
---------|----------|----------
BPM | 11.5 | 8.7
NET | 12.0 | 11.7
PER | 31.6 | 26.0
PIPM | 9.0 | 6.1
RAPTOR | 9.2 | 7.7
RPM | 9.8 | 8.0
VORP | 6.0 | 5.7
WAR | 11.0 | 11.2
WS | 10.4 | 9.5
WS-48 | .282 | .218

And just like their defense this season, their impact stats aren't all that close either. Every impact stat favors Giannis. In every impact stat I could possibly find, Giannis was always ahead. He's been dominant, simply put.

So there you have it. There isn't a sound argument for LeBron capturing his 5th Most Valuable Player award, at least not in a statistical sense. And these aren't even all of the advanced numbers I could find. I just wanted to make a relatively quick post about this whole MVP conversation.",nba,Giannis Antetokounmpo vs. LeBron James: Is this even a race?

Opp 2nd Chance points: 8.5 (35th among C).          
Def win shares: 0.122 (7th among C)

Obviously some of these require context. For instance Lopez probably isn’t that terrible of a rebounder (Giannis just gets them all) and Gobert isn’t that “bad” defensively, some of it like his def rating, is affected by his teammate quality. As a whole, the Bucks are a better defensive team so you’ll see Brook benefit on that end.    

However the main point I wanted to make was even if you want to argue the numbers, Gobert and Brook are not far off defensively. 
 

On offense Lopez is clearly more talented than Gobert. He is a capable 3Pt shooter (had a down shooting year but he still gets guarded which is all you need), has an excellent post game and can also finish around the rim whereas Gobert shoots sub 40% anywhere further than the rim. 

Are you ready to max out 28 year old Gobert when Brook (32) probably won’t even get 20 million for a long contract because of lack of hype? On mobile so please bear with me if this formatting looks shit",nba,Brook Lopez provides more value at the C than Gobert does.

1157,markymarq,1594590065,17,1,"I created a spreadsheet to track how all the contending teams matched up against each other during the regular season. My aim was to use **Off Rtg**/**Def Rtg**/**Net Rtg** to determine how good they are against the other teams expecting to make a deep run in the playoffs.

My definition of contender, for the purpose of this exercise, is any team currently with a top 5 net rtg. However, I made an exception for the Sixers and Rockets. According to 538, they both have a decent chance of winning the finals.

*Disclaimer*: This data doesn't account for anomalies like players being injured, a rested team playing an opponent after a back to back, load management, etc. Nor is the data predicting which team will win the championship. Teams increase their intensity and adjust their strategies in the playoffs and those factors will make a difference in the post-season.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XAeSBHT3uTfVGEvRC7vO_4UBf9orI3yqsvc5X_S1HRY/edit?usp=drivesdk

My main takeaways were the following:

- The Bucks have been dominant, period. The eye test and stats support them being the best team in the league by a wide margin.

- The Raptors massively underperformed compared to their standing in the East. They have the worst winning pct% and second worst net rtg. However, injuries may have played a factor into this being the case.

- The Rockets seem underrated. They have the second best winning pct% and net rtg, right after the Bucks. Outside one blowout loss to the Clippers, they've matched up well against every contending team.

- The Celtics have the highest net rtg in their two matchups against the Bucks and the third best overall net rtg. If those two teams meet in the ECF, it could make for a very interesting series.

- The Sixers matched up very well against the Celtics, winning 3 out of 4 games. They would play each other in the first round with the current playoff standings.

- The Clippers net rtg was 0, but their stats are skewed by one blowout loss to the Bucks. Considering that, plus the injuries and load management by PG and Kawhi, they are most likely better than what the stats show.

- The Lakers have the third worst winning pct%, worst def rtg, and worst net rtg. Despite being elite against non-contending teams and having the top seed in the West, they underperformed against the best competition. However, they have one outlier blow-out loss against the Celtics which negatively skewed their stats. Also, a well-rested and motivated LeBron and AD will make a huge difference in the playoffs for them.

I recently have seen people put Curry as high as #13 all time. I just can't see this, even anywhere near that number. While he has the 2016 season, which is offensively better than 99% NBA ever, someone's career isn't defined by one season. Now let's look at some of the glaring flaws when putting him up against the upper-echelon of greats.

- ""Curry is the greatest shooter who ever lived"" Correct, but imo, this will not be a true statement in the next 5-10 years. Look already at Buddy Hield or Trae Young who are already passing Curry’s 3 point records at his age. Obviously neither of them will be better than Curry, but the way the game has been evolving, there will be better shooters coming into the league soon. People said the same about Reggie Miller and Ray Allen. Shooters never age well since it’s the main thing that improves from generation to generation.

- Curry his first 3 seasons due to injury and he lost another season in the tail-end of his prime (2019-2020). This goes into how he just doesn't have the total stats to match up with other all time greats. Look at other all-time greats at the 8-15 range. Kobe had 26k points at age 31. Karl Malone had 21k at 31. Kevin Garnett had 20k. Steph has 16k points at age 31. This is true across the board for all of his stats other than 3's which is a record that will broken in the future.



- Defense. This is pretty self explanatory so I won't get too much into it. If you place Curry in the top 20 all time, he would be considered the worst defender by far of all players. No other all-time great is a liability on one end as bad as Curry.",nba,Why Steph Curry isn't near the top end of all time greats

1275,RecordReviewer,1594677039,76,1,"Anytime the GOAT discussion happens, it's usually MJ vs. LeBron. Guys like Kareem, Magic, Wilt, and Russell sometimes get brought up too. But doesn't Kareem have the best case against Jordan for being the GOAT? For me the conversation starts at Kareem vs. MJ, and everyone else is behind those two. Here are the basics:

|Player|PPG|RPG|APG|All-Stars|1st All-NBA|2nd All-NBA|All-Defense|MVP(s)|Titles|Finals MVP(s)|Other|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|24.6|11.2|3.6|19|10|5||6|6|2|2x Scoring champ, 1x rebounding champ, 4x blocks leader, all-time leading scorer, 4th most rebounds, 3rd most blocks|
|Michael Jordan|30.1|6.2|5.3|14|10|1|9|5|6|6|10x Scoring champ, 3x steals leader, 1x DPOY, 5th most points, 3rd most steals|

MJ was a better pure scorer and playmaker, and had more Finals MVPs. Kareem was the better rebounder, and probably better overall defender because of his position. Both had similar peaks, with MJ's peak being longer, but Kareem get the nod in overall longevity. 

You probably already know enough about MJ's case for being the GOAT, and in all honesty, he's still my pick. But here's the case for Kareem. 

(Just as a note, he changed his name from Lew Alcindor in the summer of 1968 after converting to Islam. I refer to him as Kareem from here on, but just know he was publicly known as Alcindor until 1971)

Greatest high-school basketball player of all-time. Kareem, Jerry Lucas, and LeBron are the only player to win Mr. Basketball USA as a junior and senior (Kareem was even runner up his sophomore year in high school). His team won the national high school boys basketball championship his sophomore and junior seasons, and was runner up his senior season. His overall record in high school was 79-2 including a 71 game winning streak.

Greatest college basketball player of all-time. In his 3 seasons at UCLA, he was the 3× National college player of the year, 3× NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player, and won 3 national titles. The 1965-66 UCLA team was defending national champs, and the preseason number 1 team in the country. Kareem couldn't play that season because he was a freshman, but still lead the JV team to victory over the varsity team that preseason. UCLA went 88-2 in his 3 seasons that he could play.

Now we've finally got to his NBA career, but I included what he did as an amateur to establish he was the greatest NBA prospect ever, and probably the greatest prospect in the history of sports. 

Here are his MVP finishes in his first 16 years in the NBA: 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3, 10, 10, 4, 4, 5.

That's 11 straight seasons as a top 5 player, and 16 straight years as a top 10 player. Kareem not only won 6 MVPs in his career, but he was in the MVP race for the first decade of his career. I'd say it's hyperbolic to assume any player could have won an MVP before coming into the league, but I have little doubt that had Kareem come straight to the NBA out of high school, he could very well have won another MVP in his career. I honestly think he could have been an All-Star as early as 15 or 16.

Kareem won his first Finals MVP at 24 years old, and his last one at 38. Think about that for a second. He was the best player on a championship team 14 years apart. There are top 10 all-time players that were lucky to be the best player on a title team in a 5 year stretch, and Kareem did it 14 years apart. 

Overall, Kareem is the most accomplished player in basketball history, and arguably the most talented. He was an elite scorer, rebounder, and defender. He dominated at every single level he played at. He not only was a terrific individual player, but he always led winning teams. From high school, to college, to two different pro franchises, Kareem was a winner every step of the way. He also had the ability to adjust to the era he played in. Dunking was banned while Kareem was in college (largely thought to be because he was so dominant at using the shot). While in college there was no shot clock or 3 point line. By the time he retired in 1989, the 3 point shot had long been established, and the shot clock had been in place for decades. 

I'll make my final point by highlighting two Kareem seasons. His 2nd and 2nd to last:

|Season|Age|G|MPG|PPG|RPG|APG|Won Title|
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|
|1970-71|23|82|40.1|31.7|16|3.3|Yes|
|1987-88|40|80|28.9|14.6|6|1.7|Yes|",nba,Why doesn't Kareem get compared to Jordan in the GOAT debate?

1282,fermi_sea,1594676761,9,1,"##Introduction

The All-NBA Team is an end-of-season award given to the best players in the league. These are voted by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters and are composed of three five-man lineups. These lineups are then distinguished as First Team, Second Team and Third Team composed of two guards, two forwards and one center. Selection is based on a weighted point voting system with five points for a First Team vote, three points for a Second Team vote, and one point for a Third Team vote. The five players with the highest point totals make the first team, with the next five making the second team and so forth.


##Data and Method


Our dataset starts with the 1988-89 NBA season and spans the period until the 2018-19 season. The 1988 NBA season is when the NBA started the current format of three separate All-NBA teams. Before the 1988 season, only two All-Nba teams where selected. The raw data consists of all countable stats like points, rebounds, shooting percentages, etc. as well as several of the so-called advanced starts such as win shares, VORP, PER, etc. This information was scraped directly from the basketball reference website.

Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks, in this case, assign probabilities for individual players to make the All-NBA First, Second or Third Teams, or miss the award completely based on their season stats.

We will construct a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict the probabilities each individual player will be the recipient of each of the All-NBA Teams. We will train our supervised learning model using historical data from the seasons from 1988 to 2018 with a series of 18 different stats both counting (per game) and advanced. We performed a grid search of the hyperparameters to optimize the model. This means we tested different combinations for factors that determine how our models fit the data and select the combination that results in the best score. Finally, the model output of the probabilities will be weighted to mirror the real-life All-NBA point system. For example, if our model predicts Player X to have a 0.50 probability to be in First-Team, a probability of 0.30 to be in Second Team and a probability of 0.20 to be in Third Team the total point calculation would be:

**Player X = 0.50 x 5 + 0.30 x 3 + 0.20 x 1 = 3.6 Total Points**

Noting that probabilities add up to 100%, with this scoring system the maximum score possible is 5.0. The predicted First All-NBA Team is selected from the two highest-scoring guards, two highest-scoring forwards and the highest scoring center. The next five players by position are the Second Team, and the next five are the Third Team.


## Results


Note, the machine learning model does not account for the player's court position. There could be higher scoring players that get left out to accommodate the 2 guards, 2 forwards and 1 center traditional format. By pure chance, for our model's prediction this did not happen and the top-15 vote-getters perfectly filled all the positions. The order below is by the highest-scoring position. Additionally, the model does not take team records into account.

**DNN All-Nba First Team:**
&amp;nbsp;

|Player|Position|Total Points|
:--|:-:|:-:|
|Giannis Antetokounmpo|F|4.57|
|LeBron James|F|3.75|
|Nikola Jokic|C|2.44|
|James Harden|G|4.37|
|Luka Doncic|G|3.52|

&amp;nbsp;

**DNN All-Nba Second Team:**
&amp;nbsp;

|Player|Position|Total Points|
:--|:-:|:-:|
|Anthony Davis|F|3.16|
|Kawhi Leonard|F|2.00|
|Joel Embiid|C|1.07|
|Damian Lillard|G|3.30|
|Trae Young|G|1.61|


&amp;nbsp;

**DNN All-Nba Third Team:**
&amp;nbsp;

|Player|Position|Total Points|
:--|:-:|:-:|
|Jimmy Butler|F|1.12|
|Domantas Sabonis|F|0.86|
|Hassan Whiteside|C|0.75|
|Russell Westbrook|G|1.35|
|Bradley Beal|G|0.93|


&amp;nbsp;


## Conclusion

Giannis (4.6/5.0) and Harden (4.4/5.0) have the highest score by a decent margin of third-place Lebron James. Apart from Hassan Whiteside, I believe all other predictions are very reasonable. The next three spots in the vote total belonged to Karl-Anthony Towns, Bam Adebayo and Rudy Gobert, all who are more deserving than Whiteside. Therefore, we can conclude that by training our Deep Neural Network model with historical data of basic stats that measure a player's performance from past All-NBA winners, we can fairly accurately predict winners for new seasons. 


Before writing my code, as a fun exercise, I made my own opinion-based predictions to see how these stacked up with the model's output. Please bear in mind that these are my non-game-watching-only-looks-at-boxscores-and-highlights opinions:

First Team — Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, James Harden, Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic

Second Team — Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Trae Young and Rudy Gobert

Third Team — Jimmy Butler, Pascal Siakam, Chris Paul, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid

I would say I did not do too bad when compared to the model and have exactly the same First-Team and most of the Second. 

Please feel free to leave your predictions for All-NBA Teams and compare them to the DNN model's prediction. If you want to know more details about the code or data please feel free to send me a message or inquire below.",nba,Using a Deep Neural Network to Predict All-NBA Teams for the 2019-20 Season

Kawhi Leonard arrived a day or two later than the rest of the Clippers due to a family event. He cleared the mandatory 48 hour quarantine in Orlando. Since he does not have social media, there doesn't seem to have been any pictures of him and what he's been up to during the shut down in the NBA.   


He appeared for the media availability for today's Clippers practice via zoom and we get to see Fun guy's face for the first time in a long time.

It's entirely fair to have players like Durant, Curry, Harden, and Chris Paul above Kawhi all time when comparing their careers as a whole up to this point. But I feel like Kawhi has less to prove in the playoffs than any of those guys. Durant needs to win a ring without Curry and the Warriors superteam. Curry needs to elevate his play for an entire playoff run and win a FMVP. Harden, CP3, Giannis, Anthony Davis all need to win a ring. 

Kawhi really had a dream run last season where he showed he can will a team to a ring. You can gripe about how he was slightly outperformed by Curry in the finals and scraped out against a decimated team. That might be true, but I still feel like that's a smaller point than KD and Curry winning without each other. You could also make the same point about Curry's only ring sans KD in 2015. From the way people talk on this site you'd think Kawhi put up like 23/7 in the 2019 Finals but he still put up an efficient 28.5/10/4. The only thing left for Kawhi is longevity. As a superstar he's stepped it up in the playoffs in 2017 and 2019 and to me the only thing he has left is to increase that sample size. 

To be clear, Durant and Curry are absolutely proven playoff performers but I still think they have more to prove than Kawhi. **Does Kawhi have less to prove as a playoffs performer than any star besides Lebron?**",nba,"Besides Lebron, does Kawhi have less to prove in the playoffs than any other active star?"

Here’s a list of what I noticed. (If you don’t want to read my post just google that shit lol - i just wanna know why it hasn’t changed)

He shoots 2 more 2’s a game than his freshman year, but that jump came from his second year, it actually went down this year. He has the same 3PA, slightly Higher 2PA, the same FTA, almost 1 more rebound a game, the same amount of assists, less steals, less blocks, the same amount of turnovers, the same amount of personal fouls, his PPG has gone up due to  higher FGA (2 more FGApg) and slightly higher shooting splits (his FT% went up .05% tho, much higher than the others) 

For his advanced stats, it definitely changes more often that his regular stats - first off his PER improves by 2.4, his TS by .023, dunno what 3PAr is but that went down .065 then up .08, his assist% went up 1.8, his TOV% went down .017, OWS went up .02, and his DRB upped .08. 

But the couple of stats that don’t change are ORB .002 change between years 1-2 and 2-3, TRB went up .006, his per game WS has had a .002 change from years 1-2 and 2-3, his BPM has grown .007 and lastly, his VORP has stayed the exact same minus a .001 decrease his 3’rd year.

I ultimately wanted to limit it to one team from any dynasty. I also was a little more influenced by a team's playoff record. Part of my process was looking at great teams, and seeing how likely they would have been to still win the title if they had to replay their playoff games. So a team like LeBron's Heat ended up missing the cut, because in my opinion, they were never head and shoulders above their competition like these other teams were.

*The Los Angeles Times* has placed Arash Markazi on paid leave as the newspaper investigates potential ethical lapses by the sports columnist, VICE News has learned.

“During this time of deep newsroom reflection, we feel compelled to demand action in response to these transgressions,” the letter states. “At stake here is not only the integrity and credibility of the sports staff, but of the entire Los Angeles Times.”

Markazi did not respond to emails and text messages requesting comment. When reached by phone, he initially said ""Hold on one second. Can you hear me?"" then went silent.

1575,Snackoff,1594933018,35,1,"Steve Kerr isn’t an elite coach. He deserves credit for implementing a great ball-movement system to absolutely maximize the potential of players like Draymond Green , and he’s good at putting role players in positions to succeed. He also unlocked the value of Steph and Klay’s gravity by having them moving all the time. He put an unselfish culture in place as well, Mark Jackson had a rather toxic one in place. He also is very good at halftime adjustments because the Warriors are a historical force in 3rd quarters under him. 

HOWEVER, he trusts role players too much, sometimes to the detriment of his team, and I think it stems from being a role player himself and knowing what it’s like to be a limited contributor, he feels everyone needs to touch the ball to feel engaged etc. 

In the 2 seasons he had with the Warriors before KD came, he was outcoached in both series where he didn’t have a clear talent advantage. 2016 vs OKC and vs CLE. Against OKC he was bailed out by Steph and Klay having the greatest 3 game shooting stretch in the history of the playoffs (legit averaged a combined 63 ppg down 3-1 on mostly contested 3s). Against CLE his role player reliance cost him, Ezeli/Varejao decisions especially (although the role players were huge early in the series). 

In 2017 the Warriors were just better, but even then their best stretch in the playoffs came with Mike Brown at the helm, cause he decided to just let the team play off of Steph and KD, and they went nuclear. Record setting playoff production even though Klay was an offensive no-show. 

In 2018 a less talented Rockets team probably should have beaten them, and they escaped because Klay/Steph and KD/Steph balled out in games 6/7. 

In 2019 a team with KD/Klay/Dray/Iggy genuinely struggled without Steph Curry (there were some other spotty injuries mixed in). He couldn’t come up with an effective offense with this cast of players, it was largely a KD carry job. In the playoffs the Warriors were taken to 6 games by a team who’s best players were Lou Will and Montrezl Harrell. The Warriors were crippled by Injury so I don’t fault him for not winning the title, but the reason they made it anywhere was largely because of star performance. KD before he went down went 34/5/5, as soon as he is out Steph comes in and puts up 33/6/6 for the rest of the playoffs.

EXCLUDING this season, Kerr is 26-26 without Steph. He also isn’t great at handling personalities imo. He was dealt a VERY fortunate hand with Steph as the team’s leader, but he can’t always keep Draymond under control, and when he felt KD was slipping away he went on a strange PR campaign incessantly praising KD at other player’s expense, and it only made KD dislike him more since KD found it fake. (They had previously butted heads over how much he ISO’d in 2018 vs the Rockets, and things carried over into 2019, as KD thought Kerr was too obsessed with ball movement. )

KD has his own issues, but we’re talking about it being to the point where Kerr was praising KD after games where Steph had 40 on better efficiency. In a game on January 13th of the 2018-2019 season, Kerr drew up a play for KD to win the game when Steph had 45 points and had hit 10 3s. KD was 10/21, and he personally had to tell Kerr to let Steph handle the play.  From this to him saying they were still figuring out how to use Steph (after 2.5 years with KD on the team) when he was having Shaun Livingston be the primary ballhandler and Steph be a decoy , it seems like he isn’t actually that great at manufacturing spacing for the team himself. 

Aside from the fact that most people credit Ron Adams for the Warriors defense, On top of that what draft picks under Kerr have developed into solid players for the team? Kevon Looney? Anyone else ? 

I think Kerr is good but I don’t think he’s a top 5 coach, and I definitely think he looks better as a contrast to Mark Jackson , and because he’s a chill, socially progressive sarcastic guy.",nba,Opinion: Steve Kerr is not an elite coach (Very long)

A 113-page guideline was released for COVID.

From ESPN:

&gt;What happens if a player tests positive for COVID-19?

&gt;The player will be isolated and retested to make sure there isn't a false positive. If it is confirmed, then the player will begin treatment and will undergo a period of rest and recovery lasting at least 14 days.

&gt;It is clear from reading the procedures in this document that doctors with whom the NBA consulted are concerned about potential cardiovascular risks that come along with having the virus. Players will be restricted from exercise and will have to pass cardiac tests before a return to basketball is even considered.

&gt;How often will people be tested?

&gt;The league says ""regularly,"" which means something less than daily. Under certain circumstances they might be tested daily.

&gt;How many people would have to test positive for the league to halt again?

&gt;It is not spelled out, but it is clear the league is preparing for positive tests. On this subject, the document says only, ""the occurrence of a small or otherwise expected number of COVID-19 cases will not require a decision to suspend or cancel the resumption"" of the season.

I just feel like this is asking for a big, gigantic asterisk for the season. What happens if half a team gets infected during the playoffs? If Davis/Lebron or Giannis or Leonard, etc get Covid a week before the finals, it's going to be such a stupid ending.

What is the threshold for positive players? Are we just going to see the season end in a few weeks?

1592,RecordReviewer,1594929857,9,1,"Norm Nixon played for legendary Georgia basketball coach Donald “Duck” Richardson in high school, and then spent four years at Duquesne before being drafted by the Lakers in the first round of the 1977 NBA draft. 

In his rookie season, Nixon averaged 14/3/7 and was named to the NBA’s all-rookie team. In his second season, Nixon was [3rd in the NBA in assists per game](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1979_per_game.html#per_game_stats::24) averaging 9 per game, and he [averaged a double-double in the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1979.html#playoffs_per_game::15) that year with 15.4 PPG and 11.8 APG.

After his first two years in the league, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson. In Magic’s rookie season, he and Nixon became the first teammates in league history to both average at least 7 assists per game for an entire season (they both averaged 8 assists per game in the 1981-82 season). 

In the 1981-82 season, Nixon averaged 18/2/8 and made his first All-Star appearance. He also had an [infamous fake free throw](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/15/sports/nba-upholds-spurs-protest.html) late in a game against the Spurs. He was taking a second free throw with the Lakers down 2 points and only 3 seconds left to play when he faked the shot, causing a double-lane violation. The referees wrongly called a jump ball, the Lakers won the toss, and Nixon hit a game-tying shot to send it to OT. The Lakers won in double-overtime, but the Spurs protested saying the fake free throw by Nixon shouldn't have resulted in a jump ball. NBA Commissioner Larry O’Brien upheld the protest, and allowed the end of the game to be restarted with three seconds left, Nixon at the line, and the Lakers down two. The Lakers ended up losing the game they had originally won once the final 3 seconds were replayed months later.

During the Lakers 1982 championship run, Nixon was the [team’s leading scorer during the playoffs](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1982.html#playoffs_totals::27) and averaged a [team high 10 APG](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1982-nba-finals-lakers-vs-76ers.html#LAL::26) in the Finals against the 76ers. In [Magic’s first 4 years with the Lakers](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html#per_game::none), it was actually Nixon who was listed as the team’s starting point guard.

After the ’83 season, Nixon was traded to the Clippers in order to better free up Magic to run the offense (Nixon was traded for future Lakers head coach Byron Scott). In his second season with the Clippers, Nixon averaged a career high 11.1 APG, [2nd in the league](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1984_per_game.html#per_game_stats::24) to former Lakers’ teammate Magic Johnson. 

Nixon made his second and final All-Star appearance during the 1984-85 season. He suffered a severe knee injury after the 1986 season playing softball in Central Park, and then tore his Achilles in a pre-season practice in 1987. Despite missing two entire seasons, Nixon came back and averaged 6 assists per game playing 53 games for the Clippers in his final season. Nixon not only retired with respectable averages of 15.7 PPG and 8.3 APG, but his assists average currently the [10th highest of all time](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_per_g_career.html#nba::none) (just ahead of two current PGs in Russell Westbrook and Rajon Rondo and just behind HOF PGs in Steve Nash and Jason Kidd). 

He only made two All-Stars in his 10-year career, but was the leading scorer on a championship team, and was a good enough point guard to play alongside the greatest point guard of all-time in Magic Johnson. Despite splitting time as the primary ball-handler during his peak years, Nixon’s career assists mark is still among the all-time greats.",nba,[OC] The forgotten great Lakers point guard from the 1980's

1683,save_the_pigs,1595017795,55,1,"The NBA has said that in order for the 9th seed to force a playoff they must be within 4 games of the 8th seed. But if there is a tie between the 8th seed teams, win percentage is the tie breaker.

Grizzlies: 32-33: .492
Trail Blazers: 29-37: .439
Pelicans: 28-36: .438
Kings: 28-36: .438
Spurs: 27-36: .429
Suns: 26-39: .400

The trail Blazers, Kings and Pelicans are all 3.5 games behind the Grizzlies. However, the Trail Blazers win percentage of .439 is +0.001 higher than the Kings and Pelicans.

The trail Blazers have played 2 more games then all the other teams. They have played 66 games, the Grizzlies have played 65, the Pelicans, Kings have played 64 and the Spurs have played 63.

Which means that if the Pelicans, Kings and Blazers all finished 4-4 in the 8 games, and all 3 finished within 4 games of the Grizzlies, then the Trail Blazers would play in the play in round, and the tie breakers wouldn't matter.

Another reason this is unfair is because the Pelicans actually hold the official tie breaker over the Blazers. The pelicans hold a 3-0 season series lead and, if the teams had played the same amount of games, would have made the playoffs over the Blazers. The kings and blazers tied the season series 2-2, but the kings have a better conference record than the trail Blazers, which means they would hold the tie breaker in a traditional season.

In a traditional season, the Pelicans hold the tie breaker over the Blazers and Kings, and the Kings hold the tie breaker over the Blazers. But in the shortened season, the Blazers hold the tie breaker because of win percentage.

Essentially, the Blazers have been gifted a tie breaker simply based off of scheduling differences.",nba,The Trail Blazers have an unfair advantage over the 4 other teams competing for the 8th spot in the western conference

For those of you who may not remember, the Chicago Bulls are a professional basketball team that played a whole 65 games this year. [Kris Dunn](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dunnkr01.html) played some phenomenal on ball defense and [Zach Lavine](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lavinza01.html) got some slight all-star buzz. One can assume other things also happened.

However, what **is** interesting about Chicago is their hectic defensive identity, an identity which resulted in them being [13th in the league](https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1) in defensive efficiency, and [lead the league](https://stats.nba.com/teams/four-factors/?sort=OPP_TOV_PCT&amp;dir=-1) in opponent’s turnover percentage. Moreover, this aggressive mentality extends to their pick and roll scheme.

# Pick and Roll Rotations

The primary tactic you will notice when watching Chicago defend the pick and roll is how high they bring up their big man who is guarding the screener, thereby pressuring the ball with two defenders and often attempting to trap the ball handler.

https://reddit.com/link/htmzbo/video/ertpmw5c3ob51/player

Here [Christiano Felicio](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/feliccr01.html) is guarding [Nerlens Noel](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/noelne01.html), the man setting the pick, and comes out past the point of the screen to pressure the ball handler, [Chris Paul](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01.html). In doing so this sets off Chicago’s defensive rotations on the back side.

*Nerd Note: when a big man comes out this high on a screen defensively, it can be referred to as a ‘high show’ or ‘hard show’. These can lead to double teams and traps on ball, but not always.*

[Super Cool Photo #1](https://imgur.com/poH3lYj)

By putting two on ball, Chicago is then forced to guard the roller and the two weak side shooters with only two defenders. Chicago’s rotations call for the weak side corner defender to rotate over to the rolling big man and for the weak side wing defender to split the difference between his man and the corner shooter should a cross-court pass be made.

[Super Cool Photo #2](https://imgur.com/cmuQng5)

As it turns out a cross-court pass is made! The defenders now must recover out to the open shooters on the perimeter. The weak side wing defender, [Tomas Satoransky](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/satorto01.html), closes out to the corner and the weak side corner defender who rotated to the roller, [Adam Mokoka](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mokokad01.html), closes out to the wing.

*Basketball bigheads call this an “x-out”. Because obvious.*

Unfortunately for Chicago, Paul’s pinpoint pass doomed this defensive possession, but by the time [Danilo Gallinari](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gallida01.html) shot the ball over Satoransky’s contest, the Bulls had recovered from their brief disadvantage through their rotations and were back in position.

# Benefits

In essence this scheme that Chicago employs is attempting to force mistakes by the opposing offense. The most obvious of which are turnovers by the lead ball handler which generally consist of bad or inaccurate passes out of the attempted trap.

https://reddit.com/link/htmzbo/video/k9l336rj3ob51/player

Here [James Harden](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html) reads the double team and attempts to make the correct play, a quick pass to P.J. Tucker who slips the screen into open space. However the pressure caused by [Lauri Markkanen](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/markkla01.html) and Satoransky results in a deflection which leads to transition. Chicago leads the league in opposing pick and roll ball handler turnover percentage by a [very large margin](https://stats.nba.com/teams/ball-handler/?sort=TOV_POSS_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TypeGrouping=defensive).

Should an opposing player attempt to make a long pass as Chris Paul did in the first clip, Chicago is betting they will be inaccurate or ill-advised due to the on-ball pressure.

https://reddit.com/link/htmzbo/video/49qm5von3ob51/player

Here Portland runs a pick and pop with [C.J. McCollum](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html) and [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html). McCollum doesn’t deal with the double well, retreat dribbles toward half-court, and makes a bad pass attempt to [Damian Lillard](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01.html) in the corner. Kris Dunn got the steal for this play, but Zach Lavine and Lauri Markkanen caused the turnover with active hands on ball.

The philosophy of this defensive strategy is to cede nothing, and force offensive mistakes by getting the ball out of primary creator’s hands, while maintaining constant pressure.

# Drawbacks

Teams that pass well can really dice up this scheme. Ball handlers that can hit the weak side corner shooter or the rolling big man quickly can give this defensive strategy real problems. Moreover the backside rotations can be difficult for players to reliably execute, especially if they have minimal experience in the league.

https://reddit.com/link/htmzbo/video/nwswsbly3ob51/player

Portland runs a high pick and roll with [Skal Labissiere](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/labissk01.html) and Lillard. [Wendell Carter Jr. ](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cartewe01.html)shows high enough to force [Thaddeus Young](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/y/youngth01.html) to rotate over from the corner, and Lillard dimes up Anthony in the corner for three.

If you have been paying attention you would notice that [Coby White](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteco01.html) doesn’t sink appropriately on this play, instead staying attached to his man and forcing Young to both rotate to the roller and close back out to the corner shooter, his original man.

[Super Cool Photo #3](https://imgur.com/OBJAXus)

White(appropriately circled in White) needs to take a couple steps back here, in order to close out to the corner should the ball go there, he doesn’t, and Portland get themselves a wide open corner three. Rookies struggle on defense. It is known.

Another counter to doubling the ball as Chicago does is to quickly hit the big man in his roll, allowing the big to pressure the basket or hit shooters on the weak side.

https://reddit.com/link/htmzbo/video/iwen7lue4ob51/player

Brooklyn runs a high pick and roll in which [Deandre Jordan](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordade01.html) slips the screen and [Spencer Dinwiddie](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dinwisp01.html) passes to him early. In getting rid of the ball so quickly, Dinwiddie effectively negates any advantage Chicago’s gains from having a second defender in his face and puts tremendous stress on Chicago’s rotating defenders.

*Nerd Note: early passes to the rolling big man like in this clip are called a ‘short roll’. This is in contrast to Jordan rolling all the way to the basket as a lob threat.*

[Super Cool Photo #4](https://imgur.com/NKWzm7G)

At this point in the play, Chicago’s goose is cooked. Satoransky has depth, but he is faced with guarding two three point shooters as [Denzel Valentine](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/valende01.html) has rotated over from the corner to Jordan. Satoransky chooses the closer of the two in [Caris LeVert,](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leverca01.html) and [Joe Harris](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harrijo01.html) drills the wide open three after Jordan makes the simple pass.

*Nerd Note : Harris moves from the left wing to the top of the key while Dinwiddie is passing to Jordan. This subtle movement made it basically impossible for Satoransky to split the difference between him and LeVert, ultimately resulting in a wide open look.*

The greater point here is how the short roll and cross court corner pass are the built in flaws of this defensive scheme, ones which this strategy doesn’t really have adaptations for.

# Final Thoughts

Something I have yet to mention is the role of personnel in the execution of this defensive style. Mobile big men that are comfortable guarding and pressuring on the perimeter is a must, as well as heady versatile wings that can rotate multiple times on the weak side and contest shots at the rim. The Bulls’ big men performed admirably in this capacity, as it was their backside rotations that often let them down.

Needless to say you don’t want giants like [Brook Lopez](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lopezbr01.html) or [Joel Embiid](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lopezbr01.html) in this strategy attempting to double ball handlers so far from the basket. Nor would you want undersized guards like [Kemba Walker](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/walkeke02.html) attempting to rotate over from the weakside to tag rolling big men.

In a perfect world, this scheme would want a very mobile big man pressuring the ball while all-world athletes roamed the weak side looking to contest everything at the rim, get steals off bad passes to the short roll, and turn turnovers into transition highlights. Maybe this team would play in a tropical climate, have a bad pun nickname, and win not one but two titles.

Thanks for reading.

Aaron Holiday works himself into the playoff rotation. 

The young Heat shooters all struggle with tuned in defense that loses track of their movement less often and force Duncan out of his screening game.

Robert Covington becomes the star of the Rockets first round series as he gets streaky at the right time.

As we saw last year with OKC/Portland and Bucks/Raptors in the regular season you can’t really put too much stock into those matchups. However, it can still serve as some sort of baseline, especially given the fact that these two teams only played each other twice this season.

First game in LA was without Kawhi and PG where the Bucks won by 5 so too much can’t be taken from that. In the second matchup in Milwaukee though the Bucks blew out the Clippers who still had their top 7/8 guys but were missing Landry Shamet and JaMychal Green.

Here are the all-time career rankings in WS/48 for the players people generally consider the top 11 of all time (the order of the players is based off of [this reddit poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/fwj0ks/rnbas_top_10_greatest_players_results/)).

And this isn't just the case for WS/48. BPM and other advanced stats also rate Kobe way lower than expected, while rating the other players closer to the general public view of them. Why is this the case?

So this post is to highlight players whose clutch performances might have gone unnoticed.

# Terry Rozier

*54.5/45.5/81 \[70.6% TS\] ; 15-16 (W-L) ; 66 FGA total*

Rozier has been overshadowed by Graham's surprising season, and his contract has been commented on the whole season but he was pivotal in leading the team to a near 0.500 clutch record (0.354 regular season record).

* He has the **highest FG% and 3P% out of 21 players** with more than 50 FGA and 20 3PA
* Rozier's efficiency (70.6% TS) seems even more impressive considering his immense volume *(****#9 FGA and #6 3PA total***). 

Aside from shooting efficiency, his rebounding and defense adds even more value

# Joel Embiid

*52/46/92 \[72.4% TS\] ; 13-9 (W-L) ; 42 FGA total*

Embiid frequently made news this season due to adjustment to play alongside Horford and Simmons. However, he's been their go-to player in clutch situations with a heavy **39% USG:**

* His 72% TS is the **highest out of 87 players** who have attempted more than 25 FGA
* He's the only center in the league to have a USG% above 35%
* Embiid's shooting **46% (7-13) from 3** which is much higher than his season average of 34.8% but he's been able to make open shots in the clutch

Along with his scoring, he's a major part of the 76ers 3rd best clutch defense with his interior defense

# Joe Harris

*56.5 3P% \[68.7% TS\] ; 17-19 (W-L) ; 23 3PA total*

Harris is one of the most accurate shooters beyond the arc. It's no different when the games come down to the wire.

* He shoots a ridiculous **56% from 3** (10-23) and he's the only player to shoot higher than 50% from beyond the arc (&gt; 15 3PA)
* Even though he is known for his three pointers, 52% of his shots are 2 pointers and almost all of those are attempted at the rim
* Also, he doesn't require the ball to be effective - every single one of his three pointers made are assisted; one might say that he could fulfill the *glaring need for a complementary piece* next to a ball dominant player on the Nets*ahem*

# Danilo Gallinari

43/45/92 *\[66.0% TS\] ; 24-13 (W-L) ; 51 FGA total*

Chris Paul has gathered a lot of attention for his clutch performances and rightfully so but one player can't take a team to a 29-14 record. It was hard to pinpoint to one single player as their second best but Gallinari's ability to stretch the floor as a big and get to the line with the occasional post up is significant:

* Gallinari is one of nine players who've attempted at least 30 clutch 3-pointers, and the only one who isn't a guard
* He's made **45% (14-31)** from beyond the arc and **92% (25-27)** from the line in his 138 minutes

# Ben Simmons

*4.3 stl per 100 clutch poss ; 20-11 (W-L)*

Frankly, Simmons doesn't have flashy offensive numbers or doesn't play a big part on offense (in crunchtime) and his USG% (12%) is the lowest on the the 76ers closing lineup. On the other hand, his defense has been exceptional throughout the season and his natural athleticism and length allows him to disrupt opposition offense and suffocate players. His defensive activity definitely tones up a bit in crunchtime

* **His STL% (stl per 100 possessions) of 4.3** is remarkable and he's the only one to have stl% higher than 4 (min 50 mins)
* He's made a total of 9 steals in 95 clutch mins; only 3 other players have made 9 or more steals and they're all OKC players who have played more than 130 minutes

Evaluating defense from raw stats or d-rtg doesn't really paint the whole picture but his numbers stand out, and he's shown that he can impact games with his clutch defense

[*Sixers vs Pacers*](https://streamable.com/g25fsr) *: 3 clutch steals in the final minute to win the game*

[*Sixers vs Knicks*](https://streamable.com/86tw1) *: Clutch steal off the inbound to seal the game*

# A few other players who had notable clutch numbers:

**Ja Morant** \[53.8/0/73\] \[59.8% TS\] - It's impressive for any player to shoot nearly 54% (28-52) of his shots where 85% of FGs are unassisted, let alone a rookie. He hasn't taken enough 3PA to judge on that but the biggest knock on him is that he turns the ball over quite a bit (15 TO ratio) which is not surprising for a first year.

**Dennis Schroder** \[51/25/90\] \[63.5% TS\] ; **Shai-Gilgeous Alexander** \- \[57/33/77\] \[67.3% TS\] - Both players have played a lot of minutes and have the same FGA (47) but there's a slight variation in how they get their points. Schroder has been the better Midrange and FT shooter while SGA has taken more attempts at the rim and has been more active on defense with 10 total steals. Neither of them are good enough three point shooters.

**Jayson Tatum** \[54/39/78\] \[65% TS\] - Tatum has been one of 21 players with high volume attempts(&gt;50 FGA, &gt;20 3PA) and he's second in FG%(34-63) and sixth in 3P%(9-23) among those players. The common complaint that he isn't getting to the FT line is evident here as well, having the 5th lowest FTA (23) out of 29 players with at least 50 FGA.

**Kyle Lowry** \[48/43/83\] \[67.7% TS\] - Lowry has all around good numbers with efficient shooting(23-46;12-28), willingness to pass(20 AST%) and ability to defend well.

**Anthony Davis** \[39.7/40/75\] \[54.8% TS\] - Davis has shot *40% (8-20)* from distance which is desirable considering he could often be left open when defenders help off him when LeBron's in isolation but his rough 2P% isn't helped by the fact that he has 1 assist in 87 minutes.",nba,[OC] 5 Clutch players that might have gone under the radar

1937,The_Nephew_King,1595283548,84,0,"Looking at the odds for MIP, Bam is the leader with Ingram and Doncic close behind but Khris Middleton isn’t even on the list. Why is that? He has taken massive leaps in efficiency this year and was looking like a top 10 player. He was .001 FG% away from being in the 50/40/90 club, which puts him in pretty elite company. Is it because his counting stats didn’t have a massive jump the way Ingram or Doncic or Bam did?

*Middleton Last year* - 18/6/4 on .441/.378/.837 on .558 TS%

*Middleton this year* - 21/6/4 on .499/.418/.908 on .619 TS% which is tied with Dame for 5th among guards.

(1. Seth Curry -.650, 2. JJ Reddick - .639, 3. Norman Powell -.629, 4. Ben McLemore - .622, T5. Dame, Middleton - .619)

Although his counting stats didn’t take a big jump, across the board everything else did. He was having a fantastic season and I’m just curious if anyone else thinks he should be talked about for MIP

Also I’m surprised the odds have Bam as the favorite, I would’ve thought it would be between Luka and Ingram who both took giant leaps in both efficiency and their counting stats.",nba,Why isn’t Khris Middleton in the conversation for Most Improved Player?
1938,kingwroth,1595283502,101,10,"So All-NBA teams are decided based on play up to mid-March, so what should they be?

First Team depends on whether AD is counted as forward or center. I honestly have no idea if they will. In 2015 he was a forward but then 2017 and 2018 he was center. According to BBref he has played PF 62% of the time and center 38%, but that didn't stop Tim Duncan from racking up All-NBAs counted as a forward even when he started playing majority center halfway through his career.

I'm going to assume he's gonna be listed as a power forward but that may be wrong.

Here are what I would give:

**First Team:**

James Harden, Luka Doncic, Lebron James, Giannis, and Jokic.

**Second Team**

Lillard, Chris Paul, Kawhi, Anthony Davis, Embiid

**Third Team**

Westbrook, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, ~~Jayson Tatum~~ ~~Jimmy Butler~~ Jayson Tatum, Rudy Gobert

1949,zaepoo,1595282323,53,0,"I'm not a Pistons fan, and I have nothing against Steve Nash. I enjoyed watching both of them when I was growing up. However, Ben Wallace not being a first ballot hall of famer is a bit troubling for the NBA. Both HoF and MVP voter seem to forget that half of the game is defense.

 If you are voted as the MVP of half the game 4 years then that should get you into the hall. We all know that James Harden is headed there someday (regardless of how you feel about him), and he has an MVP for being the best offensive player. DPOY candidates only get love for the MVP if they're also great on offense, and even in those cases it seems like their defensive contributions are overlooked (Kawhi). Defense isn't flashy, but it is what actually makes games more exciting. If every team played defense like the Wizards this year the NBA would be unwatchable.

Ben Wallace was essentially the Bizarro Nash. So if you're going to allow players like Steve Nash into the hall, you have to let in the Ben Wallace's too.

Edit: I didn't think that I'd actually need to clarify this, but  comparing Ben Wallace to Steve Nash is a rhetorical tool. I'm not saying anyone should be kicked out of the HoF. What I am saying is that the defensive side of the ball is equally as important, so offensively challenged guys who excelled at defense should get in just like all of the guys like Nash. Also, I'm not really slamming Steve Nash. You can replace his name with any offensive juggernaut that couldn't stop anyone on defense.",nba,If Ben Wallace doesn't make the Hall of Fame then take Steve Nash out

 Two things:

1. I EXTREMELY stretched the definition of ""star""/""notable"" player for the sake of thoroughness

2. Despite what happened with Porzingus, I don't count people on Rookie contracts because they still have to become restricted free agents and thus have very little leverage (as far as I know, no player worth a max contract has ever taken their qualifying offer to get out of a place sooner)

**Pacific**

**Lakers:**AD could just walk this offseason if he really wanted, really can't see Lebron asking for a trade unless maybe they implode in the playoffs and AD walks (but again, that doesn't seem very likely)

**Clippers:** PG/Kawhi just got there and have player options in 21-22, so it would be more likely they leave than ask for a trade

**Warriors:** Curry seems happy, Klay/Dray just re-signed

**Kings:** Fox is on rookie deal, imo no one else fits the bill

**Suns:** Booker is signed through 23-24, with no player option, so he really doesn't have a lot of leverage 

**Northwest**

**Nuggets:** Jokic is signed through 22-23 and doesn't seem unhappy, Murray begins his 5 year deal next year

**OKC:** Whether CP3 wants out or not is not the issue with trading him lol, SGA is on a rookie deal

**Portland:** Dame/CJ just re-signed and don't seem to be unhappy

**Timberwolves:** Same as Booker, KAT is signed through 23-24 with no player option so he doesn't have a lot of leverage, also they just traded for his buddy D'Lo (who he himself is signed through 22-23)

**Jazz:** The team with the most ""He Gone"" buzz atm. Mitchell is an RFA so unless the team REALLY thinks he will take his QO (which no Max RFA has done before), he doesn't have leverage. However, Gobert has a year left and is in prime position to demand a trade (but there have been rumors, or at least speculation, that the Jazz would want to trade him rather than overpay him anyway)

**Southwest**

**Spurs:** This is assuming DeMar/LMA still count. DeMar has a PO and can walk if he wants. LMA has a year left and it's totally possible he asks for a trade if the team goes in a different direction next year, but he's not exactly a hot commodity at 35 years old and $24 mil

**Mavs:** Zinger just got there/signed, and Cuban is more likely to sell the team than he is to give into a Luka trade demand

**Grizz:** Ja/JJJ are on rookie contracts

**Pels:** BI is an RFA this off-season, and Zion has 0 leverage

**Rockets:** Maybeeee in 1-2 years if this duo isn't successful, but Westbrook/Harden are buddies and probably wouldn't want to break it off after 1 year even if it didn't go well in the playoffs this year. 

**Atlantic**

**Raptors:** Siakam is signed through 23-24, Lowry has 1 more year but they just won the title so he probably stays as long as the team will have him

**Celtics:** Kemba just signed, Brown just got extended, and Tatum is an RFA 

**76ers:** Horford seems unhappy, but he just signed and his contract isn't great so idk if they could even trade him. Harris also just re-signed (and his contract is also not awesome). Simmons is signed through 24-25, and embiid is signed through 22-23 but since there seems to be fit questions about the two together, I could see the team capitulating if one of them do request a trade.

**Nets:** KD/Kyrie just got there, but who knows with Kyrie lol

**Knicks:** RJ is a rookie, and uh, does Mitchell Robinson count?

**Central**

**Bucks:** Giannis is a tough case. The current team is built to his strengths well enough to have won the most games in the regular season two years in a row, and unless this playoffs is a total flame out, he probably will have confidence that next year they will be contenders as well. The only way I see him getting traded instead of walking on his own next year would be him being dead-set on the 5 year supermax for his next team (but everything Giannis has said till now makes it seem like he cares more about winning a championship than getting the absolute most money he possibly can), or there being a team that can offer a great package for him without gutting their team. For those reasons, I think it's more likely he stays one more year rather than request a trade. As for Middleton, his PO isn't until 23-24

**Bulls:** If Lavine counts, he could, but more likely Boylen get fired and Lavine gets to continue to be the man

**Pistons:** They want to trade Griffin lol

**Cavs:** Sexton still on rookie deal, no one wants to give up assets for Love

**Pacers:** Oladipo could request a trade but, with injury issues and one year left, he probably would just want to play out his deal normally to establish his value for the next contract. Sabonis/Turner are both signed for a while, but similar to Embiid/Simmons there are fit issues and the team would probably capitulate if one asked to be traded

**Southeast** 

**Heat:** Bam is RFA, Butler just signed there (and unlike his past two locations, specifically wanted to be here)

**Magic:** Vucci Mane signed til 22/23, Isaac RFA, Gordon is a legit possibility (and yes I'm REALLY stretching the definition of ""notable player"" here)

**Wiz:** Good luck moving Wall, Beal re-signed at the point people previously expected him to say ""get me outta here"" and seems to like being THE guy

**Hawks:** Trae is on rookie deal

**Hornets:** I apologize to Charlotte fans, but even I can't stretch the definitions that far

I'll be looking at three other players and comparing their MVP case to Nash. Note: I firmly believe Kobe was the best player in the league at this point. But I understand team success is a huge part of traditional MVP voting. Even though Kobe received the 2nd most first place votes, I won't look at him in these comparisons. 

Stats sourced from Basketball Reference.

---
The case for **Steve Nash**

* 19/4/**10.5** on 3.5 TOs, **63% TS**, 0.212 WS/48, 5.0 BPM, 4.9 VORP, 121 ORTG, 109 DRTG, +9.1 On/Off

* Played 35.5 minutes in 79 games to lead team to 54 wins

* Lead the league in TS% as a guard which is pretty nuts

* Lead the best offense in the NBA

---

The case for **Dirk Nowitzki**

* 27/9/3 on 2 TOs, 59% TS, **0.275 WS/48**, 8.1 BPM, 7.9 VORP, 123 ORTG, 103 DRTG, +8.2 On/Off

* Played 38.1 minutes in 81 games to lead team to 60 wins

* Good scoring numbers and efficiency on the 2nd team in the West / 3rd in the league

___

The case for **Lebron James**

* 31.5/7/6.5 on 3 TOs, 57% TS, 0.232 WS/48, **9.1 BPM**, **9.4 VORP**, 115 ORTG, 104 DRTG, +10.4 On/Off

* Played 42.5 minutes in 79 games to lead team to 50 wins

* Best raw numbers of this group

* Was probably dragging the worst team of this group

---

The case for **Chauncey Billups**

* 18.5/3/8.5 on 2.1 TOs, 60% TS, 0.254 WS/48, 6.2 BPM, 6.1 VORP, **127 ORTG**, 107 DRTG, +10.4 On/Off

* Played 36.1 minutes in 81 games to lead team to **64 wins**

* Lead team to best record in the NBA

* 2nd Team All-Defense

* Best assist/turnover ratio of the group

---

When looking at the stats, I'm not sure how Nash got over 3 times the first place votes any of these guys got. In particular, I was surprised that Billups had such a good case in comparison to Nash. Efficiency and counting stats had Nash slightly ahead, but Billups lead Nash over the common advanced stats. He also lead his team to 10 more wins while being a far better defender. 

Looking at this information, I'd ultimately pick **Dirk Nowitzki** for MVP, who had the best balance between counting stats, advanced stats, and team record. Who would you pick and why?",nba,Who deserved the 2005-06 MVP?

Is it bad fundamentals to do so? Or is it just unorthodox because it's more difficult to do? Is it harder to guard? Does it not matter at all?

I practiced the move by myself so it's not like i had anyone teach me the proper foot work. i just make sure not to travel.

2188,jeffcrafff,1595452501,74,18,"This is an extremely unique situation. We've basically had an offseason in the middle of the regular season, allowing players to work on their games/bodies and/or allow lingering injuries to fully heal.

As a result, we could be seeing some significant changes and improvements that we normally only see season to season. It's entirely possible that players who were previously on the cusp of stardom will take that step in the restart.

Which players do you see making a significant improvement during the conclusion of this season?

My pick is **OG Anunoby**, who could've been a breakout defensive star already if he was healthy for 2019's title run. He's shown improvements in his offensive game, and should turn a lot of heads as he gets more TV exposure guarding #1 options in the playoffs.",nba,Post-Quarantine Surprise Players

Only the top 11 played in the NBA, and I ranked them according to career win shares. The top 3 were clearly ahead of everyone else, and the rest of the NBA guys seemed to fall in logical order.

Everyone but Taylor Jenkins played college basketball, so this was a bit tougher to rank. For the most part I ranked them according to their college production, or if they played at a high D1 school, although there are some exceptions. The most surprising might be Jim Boylen. Dude was fantastic at the University of Maine. His senior year he finished runner-up in the conference Player of the Year voting to future All-star Reggie Lewis.",nba,Ranking NBA head coaches based on how good they were as players.

NOW BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING:
_______
First, let's wet our whistles with a couple videos. We'll watch how Simmons shot the ball in-game and during shootaround at the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)  
And now compare that to how he shoots the ball in shootaround in this video taken during 'rona-times (peep the masks): [https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22)

**WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.**
______

During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a **lot** of *probably* way too in-depth studying of how to build the most efficient, simple, and fluid jumper. This eventually led me to develop the curriculum for, and coach, my own 4 day 'Shooting Camps' where a jumper is broken down to:

**Day 1** lower body  
**Day 2** upper body pre- and during-shot  
**Day 3** upper body during- and post-release of shot  
**Day 4** everything previously learned put into the overall package of a jumpshot

Okay okay okay. We're going to look at Simmons' jumper in a similar way to how these camps were structured, starting with the foundation and working our way up... We'll look at Simmons' jumper from the Nike Hoop Summit, which was at the end of his grade 12 season, and compare it to how he shoots meow.
______

**LOWER BODY**

* We see Simmons' lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot in ""[Clip 1: ""BEN SIMMONS CAN SHOOT 3's - Evidence of Ben Simmons three point range""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)"", from the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016, as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want.

* He gathers quickly and even though it is slight, he does do a 1-2 step into the catch, allowing him to load his legs up and have them read to quickly explode up to shoot. Simmons has the lengthwise centre-line of his feet under the outside of his hipbones and the outside of each foot under each shoulder, which, IMO, is the optimal stance to find the sweet-spot between balance (and we know without proper balance in your foundation, it's going to be *hellishly* tough to shoot when moving at full-speed with defenders flying at you) and explosiveness in your jumper. You can also see he is on the balls of his feet with bouncy knees, making for great elastic energy going from his legs to his upper body when shooting the ball. Finally, his lower body is all squared to his target with his feet just *slightly* angled to the right of his target as this best brings his shooting arm's elbow to point at the basket.  

* Compared to Simmons' lower body this month in [Clip 2: 7SIXERS STAR PLAYER BEN SIMMONS SHOWS HIS LONG RANGE SHOOTING IN A PRACTICE SESSION](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22) and during this season, but pre-'rona, in [Clip 3: Pull-Up Midrange Jumper In-Game](https://youtu.be/DkqGMNhSOWU?t=102), it is all quite similar.

Hmmm the lower body may not be the problem...

* *DO NOT FORGET*: The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.

**UPPER BODY**

The upper body of Ben Simmons' jumper, to quote Clive Owen in ""Inside Man"": therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

* Simmons had, as can be seen from the [2016 Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), the ball at a high shooting pocket, with his shooting thumb above his shooting eyebrow. This was great because he could see the hoop with both eyes when the ball was up into his shooting pocket. Also, since you are lining up your shooting foot, knee, hip, elbow (his is just slightly off from lining up with the rest, but it's really not a problem), and hand straight on with your target, everything simply has to extend up and out to go straight to your target. *And* having such a high shooting pocket coupled with great height and length makes his shot extremely difficult to block.

* *HOWEVER*, now, as evidenced [here](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22), Simmons has the ball moved over more in the centre of his head with his shooting thumb more above his opposite eyebrow. This means, as his lower body is still nicely lined up with his target and has not changed for the worse since 2016, he will be flicking more across from the centre of his head to finish his follow through lined up with his lead shooting foot. He's actually shooting across to get the ball to the hoop instead of just shooting it straight to the hoop... I believe because of this--as you can see--his shooting elbow is pointed out to his left a lot more in the recent shooting clips compared to the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit clips.  

* He *needs* to get that hand solidly lined up above his shooting eyebrow as it was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg) and bring his elbow in. This would stop him from having this wacky fling from right to left when shooting. You'll notice most of Ben's misses are either right or left of the target... this is probably because of this right to left slingshot/catapult he is doing.

* Lastly, and another MAJOR KEY (this post has no affiliation with DJ Khaled and if any resemblance to Khaled is perceived it is completely accidental) is, when looking at [Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), Simmons shot it so fluidly because he shot on the way up! It was SO fluid looking and with great timing on his release he was properly transferring all the power from his lower body to the upper body of his shot.

* BUT, looking at it meow, you can see from the [2019-20 in-season clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkqGMNhSOWU) and the [bubble shootaround](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=8) it's like you've just held the 'shoot-button' in 2k a liiiiitle too long and your MyPlayer (who looks an awful lot like Ben Simmons) has held his release until he's on the way down. What this does is cause a shooter to lose all the power from their legs--and as we mentioned previously all the power for your shot *should* come from the largest muscles of your body: your legs. Simmons is effectively only getting power from his upper body, the left-to-right fling shot motion he has developed. Probably a reason you don't generally see Simmons miss long.

*Aspiring coaches and shooters, remember this:*

* The upper body technique is what smoothly guides the ball to the centre of the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body in conjunction with timing your shooting release point to get the maximum power from the lower body.  
*Especially* work on using the strength of the lower body during shooting, not after you've already shot: while on your way up is the optimal time to shoot the ball as the momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body will fully transfer to the ball. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique. If you combine that with good upper body technique and releasing your shot on the way up, you'll then be most-efficiently transferring the energy from your legs into getting the ball to the rim.

**OVERALL**

* When you put it all together, Simmons had a fluid, efficient, and comfortable looking shot form in [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg). It was all one motion, and he shot on the way up.

* But now, Simmons holds his shot until he is on the way down; he has lost any fluidity he had and is losing all the power from his lower body. He relies on the current right-to-left slingshot flick he's developed. I'd love to see him rebuild, or return, to that earlier form.  

__________

I don't understand what the fuck happened. Maybe it will always be a mystery. But Ben, if you ever read this, please get back to how you shot before. It was just so damn fluid and effective.

2321,Twoweekswithpay,1595631205,117,67,"Woj spoke to Andrew Marchand. He’s now free:

&gt; The question that caused Wojnarowski to halt was if he had ever sent a “F–k you” email to anyone before he delivered that message to Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo) two weeks ago.

&gt; “I regretted sending that email,” Wojnarowski told The Post after the long pause. “I have not made a habit of doing that, but I sent that one and I regret it.”

&gt; Wojnarowski later said he had never sent an email such as that before, but he is fully regretful for his actions that led to what he thinks is the first suspension of his life, a two-week timeout without pay that has just concluded.

In regards to ESPN, he understands why he was suspended:

&gt; “I took away focus from the company,” Wojnarowski said. “In that way, I think I let people down. It is a difficult enough time that we are living in, that the company is operating in, that everybody is having to deal with. I made it harder for everybody. That was difficult to come to grips with.”

2340,favioswish,1595629827,52,34,"This may like a ridiculous statement, but the stats back it up. This is NOT an overreaction to his perfect shooting performance last night, but rather a long-standing belief about my favorite player in the league.

Many people think Seth Curry is just a shooter, but this is far from the truth. Seth is one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, allowing him to take advantage of the many varied opportunities next to Luka in the Mavs flow offense. let’s look at his case as an elite low-usage scorer:

**AT THE RIM**

Seth shoots **72% at the rim** (82 percentile), which is considered elite for a guard. He is great at abusing mismatches brought by the mavs offense and creating his own shots. He’s in the 90th percentile in efficiency scoring off drives and the 75th percentile scoring in PnR. He has a lot of skill controlling the big man on the inside, having the ability to freeze the big at the rim by feinting an attack, only to hit a short fade or hit him with a deadly floater. 


**IN THE MIDRANGE**

Seth is **1st in the league in midrange fg%** (minimum 50 attempts) at **57%** on above average volume. He has one of the most accurate middy floaters in the league, and he is deadly on long 2s, shooting **56% from 16ft-3p, good for 3rd in the league**. To put it simply, he’s the best low-usage midrange player in the NBA


**FROM 3**

I know I don’t have to tell anyone this, but Seth is an all-time great shooter. He is **2nd all-time in career 3p% 44.3%** and **2nd this season in 3p% at 45.3%**. He is always ready to pull the trigger, averaging **7.1 3p attempts per 36**, and his movement off ball, as well as the defense Luka draws, creates plenty of opportunity. 

After reading about his incredible efficiency on every part of the floor, it may not surprise you that, if he had enough minutes to qualify, Seth would be **11th all-time in career ts%, right behind Reggie Miller**



**IF HE’S SO GREAT, WHY HAS HE PLAYED BACKUP MINUETS HIS WHOLE CAREER?**

Unfortunately for Seth, he is the size of a PG while having the play-style of a SG. This makes it difficult for most teams to play him with a primary playmaker without sacrificing too much size (not an issue with the Mavs, considering their PG is 6’7 and guards forwards). Seth is not a bad defender, but he isn’t nearly good enough to make up for his positional awkwardness. This, combined with the fact that he was a late bloomer and didn’t get playing time until his late 20’s, means he’s just now getting his first real shot at being an important piece. 


**IN SUMMARY**

I believe if Seth was given the full-time starting role can score 18-20 a game on fairly low usage with near league-best efficiency (as he was after being reinstated into the starting rotation midway through the season), being third scoring in scoring on a championship level team.",nba,Why Seth Curry can be the best low usage scorer of all time

Kuzma plays all of his time at the 4. So he doesn't have a spot in any lineup featuring AD along with McGee or Dwight. If the Lakers go small and play AD at the 5, I'd rather see a three guard lineup (Caruso, Green, KCP) plus Lebron. If not, Kieff seems like a better option at the 4 as a slightly better 3 point shooter who demands less touches and isn't a turnstile on defense.

2432,ouiuyugftf,1595715174,591,1,"OFFICIAL r/FuckKyleKuzma Bible.

1. Kuzma shoots **29%** from three (6% below league average) and **43%** (3% below league average).  While already incredibly inefficient, these numbers become worse when you realize that Kuzma often shares the floor with a superstar such as LeBron James or Anthony Davis or both.  These superstars, while not only possessing otherworldly court vision, the defense often collapses and contorts to contain them.  These numbers elude to the fact that while Kuzma's looks may be rather uncontested or low in difficulty, **Kuzma either lacks the basketball IQ to select high percentage shots, or just lacks scoring talent.  Considering how Kuzma is a strictly offensive minded forward, these numbers are concerning for Lakers fans to say the least.**

2. While Kyle Kuzma's usage rate has been steady at around **21%-23%** compared to his previous two seasons, Kuzma averages **5.2** less points than last year.  **Stable usage and decreased scoring over multiple seasons means a drastic drop in efficiency.**

3. Kuzma's assist to turnover ratio, AST/TO is **.8**, and the lowest of the Laker's guards and forwards by a considerable margin.  This means he is more likely to turn the ball over than he is to set another player up for a score.  For reference, **Kentavious Caldwell Pope, a player who earns similar minutes and plays on the wings with Kuzma  AST/TO is 2.6, 1.8** ***higher.***

4. Kuzma's net rating is **5.3**.  Net rating can be defined as a metric to measure how much better or worse a team becomes when a player is on the floor.  While Kuzma has a positive net rating, the Laker's average net rating is **7.4**.  **The Lakers, a contending team with nearly 50 wins becomes inherently worse when Kuzma is on the floor.**  Kuzma's net rating is no doubt where it is because of the talent around him, and not himself.

5. While Kuzma is an offensive minded forward, his defense has somehow regressed from previous seasons.  Kuzma's struggles on the defensive end have been well documented by Laker fans, as he lacks the foot speed and defensive IQ to guard the more talented small forwards, but also lacks the strength and low post presence to contain power forwards.  This is proven by Kyle's **Defensive Box Plus/Minus** which calculates a players efficiency at stopping an opposing player from scoring, adjusting to a league average team.  Kuzma's is **-1.3, proving him to be a defensive liability.**  Kuzma does not lack the frame nor wingspan to be an effective defender, seemingly just the effort.

6. This the one that pisses me off the most.  While I dont have any fancy metrics or advanced stats to prove, Kuz seems more concerned with being an Instagram model than an NBA player.  Kuzma did a Vanity Fair photo shoot February 11th, one day before the Lakers pivotal February 12th matchup with the at the time 2nd place Denver Nuggets before the All Star Break.  Kuzma dropped 3 points, and had a plus minus of **-11.**  Furthermore, Coach Frank Vogel wisely decided against playing Kuzma in crunch time, instead opting those minutes to former two-way guard Alex Caruso.  **I'm sure there are many more instances of Kuz pulling shit like this, but I don't have the patience nor will power to scroll through his social medias and cross reference his shitty performances.**


I'm sure there is a mountain of evidence and statistics to prove that the Lakers should've dumped Kuz during the deadline when they had the chance, but I regress.  I feel I have encapsulated Kuz's offensive and defensive incompetency, as well as his reluctance to contribute to a contending NBA basketball team.  To simplify and summarize the article, Kuz has regressed majorly on offense, is a defensive liability, and makes the Lakers worse when he steps onto the floor.

The common understanding is that home-court advantage gives the team an edge during the playoffs and plays a role in who wins any particular series (isn't always true, but usually is). But I've also heard arguments about how home court advantage isn't that important, it's just that the teams with home-court also have better regular-season records, i.e. they're just better teams. 

So, we'll see? It'll be an interesting one-time experiment where season records are still relevant, but no team ever has home-court advantage during the playoffs.

So my girlfriends dad works construction, mostly on houses. He works for a pretty reputable company that does a lot of construction on gates communities and has worked on a lot of famous peoples houses. 

Last year he was working on a house, and my GF said it was one of Lebron’s houses, she knows I’m a huge Lebron fan. I didn’t believe her, so I asked where it was and did my research and found out it was his house. She asked if I wanted her dad to bring me a souvenir, I thought she was joking, so of course I said yes! 

The next day she brings me this bag of coins, of course I was confused! Her dad said that there was a box outside of the house for the workers, that said something along the lines of “free stuff”, with a bunch of random free items that I guess they didn’t want anymore. This bag of coins was in it. They were extremely dirty and looked like they were in a lake for a long time. I had to clean them off by soaking in vinegar. That’s how I got Lebron’s coins! 

Obviously this could have been a lie to make me happy since I love Lebron. However I don’t think they would lie to me, and choose to believe it’s true until proven otherwise

Giannis has also played the same MPG as Joe Harris, and 1.6 MPG less than Marcus Smart, another very notable 6th man. 

Granted, all of these players basically play starter minutes, but their minutes are de facto restricted on their team because the starter at their position is more well-rounded and hence deserves more minutes (except for Lou’s case) except in certain circumstances. Giannis has no such restriction. Him playing more than he does is literally unsportsmanlike with the way he dominates. 

He’s even played less minutes than “Mr. Load Management” Kawhi Leonard, despite Kawhi having a far better supporting cast to ease his minutes. 

He is 63rd in the league in minutes, putting up top 5 rebounding and points per game, and is top-2 on his team in **every statistical category** except 3-pt shooting. Not to mention top-2 DPOY candidate. 

It’s just wild that his play style is basically auto-load-managing. He could play more if he wanted to. He doesn’t have to. They still have the best record in the league and he’s the runaway MVP. 

I just don’t see anyone can make a case against this man for not just MVP but a historic season. He just can’t stop getting better. 

Tangentially speaking of trajectories, Pascal Siakam is basically gonna be this man with slightly less dominance but a way better jump shot in just 1-2 more years. It’s a good time to be an NBA fan.

They could theoretically move some piece around for more bigs that can shoot or rebound and play defense and just fill up there roaster with nobody under 6’7.  They’re certainly already in a position to do so with most of their players being 6’5 or bigger with a few exceptions. They could make a move for Boban, Tacko, Kelly Olynyk, Mo Bomba, ideally Porzingis  but we all know that will NEVER happen which was the main reason I said Kelly Olynyk since he’s like a discount Porzingis kinda sorta but what I’m getting at is they could make the biggest nba team in history within a few seasons. 

They would be slow but you can make up for that by playing a zone like defense that switches on pick and rolls since everyone might be tall enough to still get pressure on the shot if they shoot over top the screen. Virtually all you could do against a team like that is shoot the 3 ball so teams like golden state would do better against them but I still think the size advantage will be too much for most teams to handle. 

Just something fun to think about.

According to the post, Tim Grover went off on how the NBA can be so modern, yet it doesn't even have a weight room. According to the post, ""Grover’s argument is simple. Moving iron is the single best injury prevention technique.""

I personally found the idea regarding NBA athletes and weight training quite interesting. I feel as though there is a fine balance that a player must define when he is training, because I have heard that weight training will help with injury prevention and the ability to take a hit to the body, however I have also heard that working out too much in terms of weight training may negatively affect your shooting ability. 

KD famously was unable to do a 185 pound bench press at the draft combine, however he still was taken second overall, which goes to show that NBA scouts were unaffected by his weight training inability and rightfully so, he is often regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history now.",nba,Tim Grover goes off on Modern Workouts

&amp;#x200B;

Former British Empire's 12 Man Roster: 

C: Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria), Andrew Bogut (Australia), Steven Adams (NZ)

PF: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Nigeria), Tristan Thompson (Canada)

SF: Luol Deng (Sudan), Al Farouq-Aminu (Nigeria)

SG: Ben Simmons (Australia), Ben Gordon (UK), Jamal Murray (Canada)

PG: Steve Nash (Canada), Patty Mills (Australia)

PF: Nikola Jokic (Serbia), Kristaps Porziņģis (Latvia)

SF: Peja Stojakovic (Serbia), Andrei Kirilenko (Russia), Toni Kukoc (Croatia)

SG: Drazen Petrovic (Serbia), Bojan Bogdanovic (Croatia)

PG: Luka Dončić (Slovenia), Goran Dragic (Slovenia)

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously Team Former British Empire has the top talent, they've got Hakeem (a top 10 player of all time) Giannis and Nash, arguably the 3 best players between the two rosters, however their depth is fairly weak, and their fit isn't incredible. Nash is best when he has shooters to space the floor and this roster has 2 decent shooters and the rest are very much low post scorers or need the ball in their hands to thrive. 

Team former Eastern Bloc +China on the other hand fits incredibly well. Everyone can pass, everyone is has length and everyone can space the floor. Prime Sabonis could probably hold his own against Hakeem, but Jokic would have a difficult time guarding Giannis, they may have to throw AK47 on him.

20 points 10 assist.  
30 points 5 asst.  
40 points 0 assist.

2711,EE_trojan,1595978869,17,1,"There are extreme, government orchestrated human rights violations against the Uighurs in China. NBA players, owners, and leadership have an obligation to publicly condemn this. The NBA has been silent on this issue, likely due to the $500 million dollars a year they make from China.  

There are several reasons the NBA's silence is morally unacceptable in this situation:

1) The NBA has intertwined itself deeply with social issues. They have branded themselves as a group that cares about social activism and racial equality. Not taking a stance about this issue is in direct opposition to the slogans they are now promoting. 

(Approved jersey slogans include:  Justice; Equality; Freedom; Power to the People; Justice Now; Liberation; Stand Up; Ally; Anti-Racist; Speak Up)

2) The NBA has been cultivating a relationship in China and intentionally increasing their outreach there for years. China is not a random country to the NBA, it is the top market outside of North America. It is a huge position of privilege to rake money out of Chinese markets and not have to care about social issues there. 

3) As for the argument it is only part of China, the NBA literally used to run a training camp in the middle of Xinjiang provence where there are now over a million people in forced-work camps.

4) The issue of speaking against the CCP has already come up with the NBA and they encouraged silence. Daryl Morey's ""Free Hong Kong"" tweet was deemed ""regrettable"" by the league. 

In the current American climate it should be obvious that speaking about human rights issues shouldn't be regrettable just because it disrupts the status quo; standing up for prosecuted racial groups is a moral requirement.

TLDR: The NBA cares about social issues until it costs them money. 

[""Silence is violence. Silence is complicit. We need to have these conversations.”](https://twitter.com/nbacares/status/1267648379934433282)",nba,It is embarrassing for the NBA that no one is speaking out about China's human rights violations

For some reason I remember the games being really close but I guess the Cavs were able to close them out.

This ultimately had me guessing what team has had the hardest path to the finals in terms of close series totals in each round (regardless of the outcome in the finals). Has there been a team that has played in 6-7 game series each round?

I thought the results were interesting so I shared them here. I had to plug in players 1-by-1 so I might've missed a few but I think I got most of the players who should be relevant in 2025.  

Caveat: I don't think 538 incorporates this season's data in their projections, so someone like Brandon Ingram or Pascal Siakam, who've taken a really big leap this year are probably being underrated without the recent data being taken into account.  

So this isn't perfect, but I still thought it was really interesting.  

Rank | Player | 2025 WAR Projection 
------ |-------|----------

1 | Jokic	| 11.7
2 | Luka Doncic | 11.3
3 | Embiid | 11.2
4 | Giannis | 10.1
5 | Harden | 9.6
6 | AD | 7.7
7 | Zion | 7.3
8 | KAT | 7.2
9 | Ja Morant | 7
10 | Jaren Jackson | 6.9
11 | Jayson Tatum | 6.3
12| Kawhi | 6.2

35 | Pascal Siakam | 2.5

Grizzlies have a 3.5 game lead on the Blazers, Kings and Pelicans. They have a potentially harder schedule than Kings and Pelicans, but no one has a clue how the better teams are going to treat this. Also, they got some players back. The cushion and having to be beaten twice (potentially 3 times by the Pels) is a huge advantage.  


Blazers, despite getting swept by the Pelicans (0-4), have the tiebreaker since they played an extra game during the season, so they get in if both teams are the same amount of games back. Blazers get Nurkic and Collins back, two huge additions, but have a pretty hard schedule.  


Pelicans have the easiest schedule left, and have Redick and Zion both fully healthy. They had the highest chance of making the playoffs pre-shutdown, the shutdown did reduce those chances (per 538).  


So, out of the teams vying for the 8 seed to play the Lakers, which team does r/NBA think will make it:

Blazers

Kings

Even Zach Lowe phrased the question expecting other players to either laugh it off or condemn Williams' actions. But Nichols actually said it was the opposite. Players didn't like the fact that the NBA even lengthened his quarantine time. And they fear there's too much oversight from the league on what the players can do.

But after a bit I feel this is exactly the reason why a bubble is so necessary for everything to work. It really is just impossible for players to keep themselves out of harm's way. If they can't even understand why going to a restaurant to eat indoors should make a player require a 10-day quarantine instead of 4-day quarantine, imagine if there were no quarantine and players travel around the US to play.

Noted that while Luka beats Kawhi in Win Shares and VORP, Kawhi beats him in their rate counterparts, WS/48 and BPM. Luka has an advantage in terms of total minutes because while he and Kawhi missed the same number of games, the Mavericks played three more games than the Clippers. 

I don't like putting weight in any single advanced stat. But I think they can be useful with context (e.g. comparing superstars with similar usage rather than saying Will Barton is better than Book or Beal cuz his RAPTOR is higher). If every one of them points in the same direction then maybe there's something to be said. 


If you don't like advanced stats, let's look at an easier stat: team performances with/without their superstar.  **The Clippers and the Mavericks had the same record in games Kawhi and Luka missed (6-7). But Kawhi went [38-13](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/leonaka01/gamelog/2020) in games he played while Luka went [34-20](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/doncilu01/gamelog/2020).** [Kawhi's](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612746/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=1) net rating (+11.4 vs +6.2) and on/off splits (+10.8 vs +1.2) blow [Luka](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612742/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=1) away. I know net rating and on/off aren't a good way to measure individual players but people have no problem using it to say Luka's Mavericks have the best offense in NBA history (highest offensive rating).

And yet so many people have Luka over Kawhi in MVP voting and making the All-NBA 1st-Team over Kawhi. (Due to positional flexibility in voting, the last F/G spot will come down to Luka and Kawhi so don't come at me with that nonsense saying Luka isn't taking Kawhi's spot because they're different positions.) 

I think it all comes down to narrative. Luka is the shiny new toy who's younger, more popular, and more relatable to the people in this community. People also get caught up in the load management narrative to disqualify Kawhi from any top regular season honors but Kawhi has been amazing regardless. Him and Luka missed the same number of games. Luka still had an excellent season but Kawhi's was just a little more monstrous.

Note: I think Westbrook can be rightfully criticized. He went nuts later in the season but advanced stats picked up that he was not contributing to winning basketball for the first half and you can't ignore that.",nba,Why do people ignore advanced stats so they can say Luka had a better season than Kawhi but use them to put down guys like Westbrook?

Wilt Chamberlain played in perhaps what was the NBA’s fastest period. Teams ran a lot and stars averaged upwards of 40-minutes a game.

Adjusting for pace, Wilt’s 50-point season is the equivalent of averaging 38-15-1 over the course of 48-minutes a game, if further adjusted to fit what star players are playing today it’s around 29-12-1, which is still a really good offensive season, but not as mind blowing as one might otherwise think. Furthermore, Wilt wasn’t ever really a playmaker and didn’t have the best efficiency early in his career, leading to his gaudy scoring numbers rarely ever translating to great offenses and problems with teammates who also wanted a piece of the action. Wilt later became a much better offensive player, eventually blossoming into a willing but at times problematic passer, all while scoring a lot less. 

On the other hand, Wilt anchored some great defenses. He’s a historical difference maker on that end and one of the few players in the history of the game who can just guarantee you a successful defense. Superhuman conditioning and a 7-foot-8 wingspan ensured Wilt could gobble up any shot in the paint and being one of basketball’s greatest rebounders also helped mightily. Virtually all of Chamberlains’ teams were at least good defensively, with some escalating to all-time levels on that end, and that’s not a coincidence.",nba,"Wilt Chamberlain wasn’t as good on offense as you think he was, but he was a way better defender than he’s often given credit for."

Additionally, he's pretty much the perfect point guard to play next to ball-handling superstars like Kawhi and PG. A lot of his production comes from spacing the floor (38% 3 point shooter) and on defense. 

I think Lou Will and Trez are better players in a vacuum due to their scoring ability. But the Clippers already have a lot of scoring in Kawhi and PG. Lou Will mainly functions as a scorer. He distributes the rock a little too, but mainly to Trez to form that 1-2 punch. He's also a complete negative on defense. I actually think Trez isn't as horrible on defense as everyone says, and I love his energy. But he's reliant on Lou Williams to be effective on offense, pretty much putting a cap on the defensive effectiveness of lineups featuring him. 

Pat Bev doesn't really have those glaring flaws on a contending team. The team feeds off his energy and struggles without him.

What if the ""home team"" had a few buttons that players on the bench could push when big plays happen, or just something they love to see. Ala ""bang bang!"" Or even ""and 1"".

Perhaps teams could have a handful of, league approved of course,  phrases the teams use privately or publicly to hype up they're boys. Instead of them rushing the corner of the court to slap hands or show appreciation, they could have them on the back wall to play an audio clip that would hype them up and either the PA announcer or a sound clip plays. 

I could be wrong but in my head it would give almost a Street ball hype style of appreciation to big plays or plays they just love to see, think LeBron's blocks from behind or someone ""breaking ankles"" on a crossover.

Could even have a few video clip buttons where they play quick clips in reaction to plays. Probably wouldn't get approved but I'd love the clip from ""they live"" of "" I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum and I'm all out of bubblegum"" after a great step back three or slam dunk. In my head it'd end up feeling like a game show seeing the players run to the wall to smash the button and have it be announced over the PA to hype up the team.

I would be interested to see similar format tried going forward.

Let's say, teams would have a regular season of 58-70 games. Then top ~22 from both conferences would make it to seeding games and complete their 82 game regular season.

This way, tanking would be substantially disincentivized, as teams which don't make it to the seeding games would have less games, thus less revenue.  

As fans, we would get to see more intense games for larger part of the season. Assuming seeding games would have higher intensity, and higher quality of play based on the teams being higher seeded, we would be treated to more interesting basketball (although less total games league wide). 

Play-offs are fun, but not many teams go on to later stages, limitation of which is that most teams have very few games, and even fewer matchups in the postseason. 

Having seeding games is more fun, because more teams get to play each other, bringing us more matchups in somewhat important game scenario. Star players are less likely to load-manage those games, and might as well go wire-to-wire more often.",nba,I love the the idea of seeding games.

3062,Proof_Tadpole,1596236150,0,1,"I want to give the basic stats before I get into what my opinion is. So, in yesterday's game against the Jazz, Zion in 15 minutes dropped 13 points on 6 for 8 shooting and 1 assist. This is kind of a weird game to analyze. Obviously, it has been five months since the players have played an NBA paced ball game, as everyone was rusty (both teams combined for more turnovers than assists), but I do have some problems that I want to point out. To me, I would say that the main fault here would be Coach Gentry. Even if you were to put Zion at a minutes restriction, you would rather him play those minutes at the end of the quarters, as opposed to the beginnings of the quarters, where Zion's presence could be more impactful (especially with the lead that the Pelicans had going into the second half), so most of what Zion had yesterday was basically due to the minutes Gentry gave him. Now, back to Zion. The eye test was kinda sloppy if I have to keep it a buck. He didn't seem ""fit""as many people have allegedly said In fact, he didn't really change from his physique from when the NBA started its hiatus (which I do not have a problem with. I am in the minority when I think his weight could be a great asset, as he will take on opposing big men both on offense and defense, but he still would need to slim down). Zion's shooting was great (75% from the field is real good), however, he did not grab a single board, which isn't Zion. I mean, maybe his motor is rusty because this is the first game back, but I at least expected 3 boards from a guy who averaged 6.5 in the pre-hiatus NBA (and I know the sample size was small, but still). But, I am not worried. He is a guy who needs to play more to feel great, and I think we will see regular Zion in the next game the Pelicans play (and those ones are crucial). But factoring in all the points, I would have to give Zion a B for his performance yesterday. But what do you guys think? Do comment down below your thoughts.",nba,What are your opinions on Zion's performance last night?

Use these cameras for replays. Use them for in-between stuff.

However I noticed all year he didn’t give much effort off ball or on d (especially in transition) and I think it’s being amplified so far in the bubble where he’s honestly looked awful even in restricted minutes. 

If you don’t believe me that Zion hasn’t been giving effort he played 15 min against the Jazz (a game they lost by 2) and had a plus minus of -16 for the game and has a -20 in 10 minutes this game. This comes out to -36 in 25 minutes which is by far the worst on his team.

3146,Dzon_Dilindzer,1596322435,1,1,"&gt;**just to give the context to the previous post about dame &amp; nurk and its worth your time**

Jason Quick 

Back home in Bosnia and Herzegovina — the old country, as Jusuf Nurkic calls it — one meets strangers with a wary eye. Maybe this reticence was born from the wars the region has endured, or maybe it comes from the hardships of poverty. Or perhaps, as Nurkic says, it is simply a mindset that has been passed down from generations.

“It probably comes from the old people,” he says. “I don’t think it’s a new thing.”

The origins can be debated, but the trait is concrete: Trust is to be earned, not given.

“If I meet a person, there are a thousand reasons why I shouldn’t trust them,” Nurkic says. “There’s only one why I should.”

That one reason, of course, is the person might turn out to be worthy of  trust, worthy of friendship. But to Nurkic, that one reason goes against the odds.

So it was with that frame of mind that Nurkic came to the United States  in 2014 and joined the Denver Nuggets as a first-round pick. He was a hulk of a man, but he was still a boy, a 20-year-old 7-footer who would soon be more than 300 pounds. His immaturity and insecurity were masked by a trash-talking bravado.

Those traits famously clashed two years later when the Nuggets made a decision to commit to another Balkan center — Serbian Nikola Jokic —  creating a reduced role for Nurkic. Hurt by the demotion, Nurkic became petulant and sullen.

By the time the 2017 trade deadline approached, the Nuggets had had enough, shipping Nurkic and his attitude to Portland in a trade. Feeling vulnerable and unsure as he entered the Trail Blazers locker room for the first time, Nurkic needed just five minutes to know his life had changed, professionally and personally.

He had met Damian Lillard, the team’s star, and immediately Lillard made an impression. In their first conversation, Lillard was direct. Honest. But he was also warm and showed an understanding of Nurkic’s story.

Nurkic got a feeling that went against everything that had been ingrained in him by his Bosnian roots. He liked Lillard. He trusted him. And he decided right then that he would open himself and allow Lillard to shape him.

Three years later, thanks to an unmistakable bond that both consider among the strongest in their lives, Nurkic and Lillard remain two of the most important pillars holding up the Trail Blazers.

Because behind their 4 a.m. phone calls and unannounced arrivals at the front door and international vacations is the foundation of what makes the Trail Blazers the Trail Blazers: friendship, accountability and family.

When Nurkic first stepped foot in the Trail Blazers locker room that February night in 2017, he was apprehensive, unsure of how he would be received and whether he would fit.

“I always knew them as players, playing them four times a season, but I didn’t know what it was like in the locker room or how they were going to be as human beings,” Nurkic said.

His first introductions were brief. The Blazers had a game that night against Atlanta, and Nurkic was being held out as his physical and other details of his acquisition were being finalized. After the blur of  shaking hands and saying hello to new faces, Nurkic found himself alone in the locker room. The players had left to warm up, and in his curiosity, he examined the video room attached to the locker room.

That’s when Lillard appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and that’s when a bond the two now say will last a lifetime first took hold. Nurkic today says “from day one” the two clicked, but more accurately, it was from that moment in the video room.

“For a couple minutes, we were alone,” Nurkic said. “And he came to me,  and I will never forget, the first thing he says to me is, ‘Look, I’m here for you.’”

Lillard made Nurkic get out his phone and put his number in it.

“He said, ‘Whatever you need, don’t be afraid to reach out,’” Nurkic remembers.

There was something about the warmth and sincerity of Lillard’s welcoming that surprised Nurkic, but what really won him over was what followed. Once the niceties were out of the way, Lillard got real. And to the point.

“He was …” Nurkic said, smiling while searching for the right words, “straight up.”

It had been a day since the Nurkic trade had been announced, and Lillard had done his research. He had read about Nurkic’s clash with Denver coach Mike Malone, how he sulked about playing time, how he spoke out about his reduced role and how he could be cocky and brash on the court.

So it was an informed Lillard who was, as he put it, “stepping to” Nurkic in that first meeting.

If Nurkic ever got out of sorts on the court, Lillard was there not only to counsel but also to deliver hard truths.

“I remember that conversation,” Lillard said. “The first thing I wanted him to know was ‘I’m on your team; I’m on your side.’ But I also wanted him to know that coming into this situation, that he had met his match. Like, I wanted him to know that with me, you’ve met your match, there wasn’t going to be no pushover situation.”

It was classic Lillard, whose leadership has created a culture that defines this era of Blazers basketball in which togetherness and accountability go hand in hand. After the welcomes and boundaries had  been set, Lillard ensured Nurkic he would start with a clean slate in Portland.

“I wanted him to be comfortable and to know that I didn’t care about what they said about him and all that stuff going on around him,” Lillard said. “But I told him, ‘That stuff they do say, if it did happen, it won’t continue. But you also need to know you are wanted.’

“I wanted him to know he could help us and that he brought something we didn’t have and that I was going to make sure we got the most out of that.”

Nurkic said he had never met an NBA player who was so real. He was  honest, up front and open to helping him. And he felt Lillard looked at him as not just a player but a person.

“He had heard stuff — ‘Oh, he has a bad attitude,’ you know, a lot of that stuff going on around me — but he was like, ‘That has nothing to do with you now,’” Nurkic said. “I felt Dame was caring about me as a person. Probably more than he should.”

Frankly, it was all a bit overwhelming for Nurkic. In Europe, Nurkic had become accustomed to veterans mentoring, but he had yet to see it in the NBA. Now, here he was, on his first day in Portland, and the franchise star was opening himself to him.

“Maybe just because where I’m from, but we respect that more,” Nurkic said. “(Mentorship) happens back home, but that’s not necessarily the case here in the U.S., the NBA especially. Some of them (do), but I don’t see a lot of that.”

As Lillard offered to trust Nurkic, the big man gave the captain a commitment. He told Lillard he wanted to learn and that “I’m not here to do crazy stuff.”

Not long after, Nurkic was on the court and starting for the Blazers. They both estimate it was within the first five games or so that their developing chemistry had a defining moment. Neither can remember the exact game, but Nurkic was struggling with his shot and ticky-tack fouls. Worse yet, he was showing versions of the Denver Nurkic. He was getting mouthy on the court and pouty about his performance.

“I kept trying to make excuses,” Nurkic said. “And saying stuff I’m not supposed to say, and Dame came up and …”

Nurkic stops, shakes his head and chuckles at the memory.

“He came up and said, ‘I don’t give a shit,’” Nurkic said. “He was like, ‘I don’t care what your excuse looks like’ … he was telling me I had to be accountable.”

Lillard said he couldn’t remember which game it was because in the beginning there were a handful of such moments.

“I said that to him a few times,” Lillard said. “I remember the first time, though, because it was just like that first conversation in the locker room. The first time I saw it, I had to nip that shit in the bud.  I told him, ‘There’s no excuses.’

“I felt like part of when he came here, a lot of the criticism and his own mentality was kind of from his immaturity and him not being held accountable.”

So Lillard confronted him right there on the court, in the middle of the game. But in true Lillard fashion, after he told him ‘no excuses,’ he also nurtured the big man. He told him to not worry, that he was still going to feed him the ball, he was still going to run plays through him.

“It wasn’t a putdown, and I think he respected it because I had already been showing that I was on his side, that I was going to support him,” Lillard said.

Nurkic didn’t know it until he experienced it, but Lillard’s leadership had been what he had wanted throughout his career. He needed that structure, that accountability, and he thrived in wanting to please his mentor.

“I was young and I was playing with a superstar, and he was allowing me to sit with him on the plane and go over each possession,” Nurkic said. “And he would tell me straight up: ‘This is wrong.’

“I didn’t have experience playing with great players — that’s not disrespecting teammates in the past, but that’s a fact. So to me, it was like, ‘I can be way better if I listen and do what he says.’”

The seeds of trust and respect had been planted. Soon, a friendship would blossom.

 Lillard and Nurkic developed a bond shortly after the center arrived in a trade from Denver.

When Mario Hezonja joined the Blazers this summer and saw the interactions between Nurkic and Lillard, he was taken aback.

Hezonja is from Croatia, the western neighbor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a 16-year-old, he and the 17-year-old Nurkic played on the same team in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb. The two lived literally within shouting distance of each other, and the joke between them is that Nurkic became closer to Hezonja’s father than Mario.

They played basketball together, and eventually they would go to a movie here and there, but Hezonja said they each kept their space.

“We were never like, ‘Bro,’ and all that stuff,” Hezonja said.

So eight years later, when Hezonja came to Portland and saw Nurkic so connected to Lillard, he did a double take.

“We come from a place where you don’t trust everybody,” Hezonja said. “And I’ve never seen him as close with somebody as he is with Dame. He just never gets close to somebody like that.”

If Hezonja were in Portland three years ago, he would have been even more surprised by how quickly the two bonded.

During the final stretch of the 2017 season, when Nurkic helped the Blazers win 14 of their remaining 20 games, he flourished under Lillard’s mentorship. All the noise from Denver about him being a bad  apple was drowned out by the roars inside the Moda Center, where a phenomenon known locally as “Nurk Fever” took hold.

As Nurkic soaked in the adulation around town, he was grounded and grateful inside the walls of the Blazers practice facility. Fearful that his career was in jeopardy after his tumultuous exit in Denver, Nurkic fully appreciated what he had before him in Lillard. With Lillard offering equal amounts of constructive criticism and nurturing, Nurkic became a more focused player, a more disciplined player and a more consistent player.

“When I came, I was in a really bad place, in basketball and probably my life,” Nurkic said. “Everything was just going the wrong way. I was fighting for my status in the NBA because I know I deserved a chance. And Dame showed up and was like, ‘Do you want this? Then do it this way.’

“It was the best part of my life, basketball-wise, what happened to me.  He is by far the best thing to happen to me in basketball.”

Lillard said that in that first season, he could see Nurkic changing, not only as a player but also in beginning to let his guard down.

“Once he realized I wasn’t just saying I was on his side, on his team, (but) that I really wanted to help him, our friendship took off,” Lillard said.

They started texting and talking on FaceTime. Then Nurkic started visiting Lillard’s home. On the road, they went to dinner together. When both were out of the game, they made sure to sit next to each other on the bench.

“Our energy started becoming more of a friendship than us being teammates,” Lillard said.

As they grew closer off the court, they became better on it.

“Once we started interacting and he started coming to the house, then it went beyond … our relationship went to a whole other level on the court,” Lillard said. “Then I could yell at him, like, ‘Mother ffff …  swing the ball … do this … stop throwing them crazy passes!’”

Nurkic insists that sometimes he and Lillard don’t have to talk to execute a play. They have watched so much film together, conferred so many times on team flights and come to know each other so well that they can just look at each other and know what the other is thinking.

“Communication-wise, we are just different,” Nurkic said. “We understand each other even if we don’t talk. If we just look at each other, we know what we are going to run. The first year I got here, the  relationship we established gave us a chance to be more successful on the court.”

Sometimes, Lillard says, Nurkic would tell him he needed the ball, and Lillard would tell coach Terry Stotts there was no need to call a play,  that he had one lined up.

“Nurk would be inbounding to me and say, ‘Let me get a post up — he can’t guard me,’” Lillard said. “And when Coach would call so-and-so play, I would tell (Stotts), ‘I got it,’ and I would run a play for  Nurk. And if he scored or got fouled, he would just give me a thumbs-up.”

It was late November, the last home game before Thanksgiving, when about an hour before tipoff against Oklahoma City, the Blazers’ locker room doors burst open.

“BABO!”

It was Nurkic, calling out the nickname he gave to Lillard after Lillard and his girlfriend had their son, Damian Jr., in March 2018. Babo means “father” in Bosnian.

“Where is he?” Nurkic said, walking toward Lillard at his locker. Nurkic was referring to Lillard’s son. “Is he here?”

Lillard shook his head in mock disgust. The Blazers had just returned from an 11-day, six-game trip, and Nurkic, who missed the trip to rehabilitate his broken leg in Portland, didn’t even bother to say  hello.

“It’s like I’m not even here,” Lillard said to no one in particular. He mumbled something about Nurkic caring more about his son than him and playfully acted hurt as Nurkic reversed and left the locker room.

Moments later, Nurkic returned, holding Damian Jr., or “Fat Man,” as he is affectionately called by the family.

Fat Man and Uncle Nurk have a special relationship. Fat Man doesn’t like to be handled, but with Uncle Nurk and his big hands, he goes on imaginary plane rides: up, down, loop de loop. All with delight.

“Fat Man, he knows Uncle Nurk,” Nurkic said. “He knows when I show up, something good is going to happen and we can probably do whatever we want.”

Oftentimes, Nurkic shows up at Lillard’s home unannounced. And when Lillard answers the door, Nurkic lets himself in, walking past his friend and teammate, in search of Fat Man.

“I care about that kid as much as possible,” Nurkic said. “You know, I love kids, and his kid is super cute, super big for his age, and it’s interesting. Whatever he does is funny to me.”

Nurkic laughs when he recalls the first word he heard Damian Jr. speak.

“I was not hearing him talk, and then I hear him just say ‘pizza’ … I  was like, ‘What?’” Nurkic said. “He called for food … that’s funny.”

So on that November night, when Nurkic fetched Damian Jr. from the family room and returned to the locker room carrying the 2-year-old in his arms like a proud uncle, he laughed as he presented Lillard with his son.

“He’s got pizza on his face,” Nurkic said.

As Lillard took his son, he wiped the pizza off and gave kisses while asking his son to say “I love you.”

“No, no,” Nurkic said after a few moments, reaching for Damian Jr. “He don’t love you, he loves Uncle Nurk.”

As he took Damian Jr. out of Lillard’s hands, Nurkic triumphantly held him up and paraded him out of the locker room. They were on to their next adventure, maybe in the playroom, or perhaps on the court.

Weeks later, Lillard brought up that scene as an indication of how comfortable Damian Jr. has become with his “uncle.”

“Normally with people, he will run to me and get right between my legs, put his back to me and grab my arm,” Lillard said. “But you can see, like in the locker room earlier this year, it’s different with Nurk.  (Damian Jr.) would have never let somebody take him from me and go away without a fight or a shout.”

It’s been like that for some time. At Damian Jr.’s first birthday party, Uncle Nurk showed up, gift in hand, and soon dominated much of the time with the birthday boy.

“There’s a bunch of people there — kids, parents — and there’s Nurk, carrying him around, holding him in the air, twirling him up and down,”  Lillard said. “And that’s the thing: He don’t like to be held usually.”

A playful back-and-forth between Lillard and Nurkic is how Nurkic always shows up at his home unannounced, usually just to see Damian Jr., sometimes with a gift in hand.

“Every time I see Fat Man, I want to bring him something,” Nurkic said.  “But it’s gotta be something else than food. That kid is too big. He’s not fat, but he’s tall, big. Every time you see him, he has grown.”

Lillard just smiles at the scenes from his house. Nurkic walking past him, in search of his son, then the two on the living room floor, lost in each other, playing with toys.

“He’s closer to my son than anybody else,” Lillard said.

When March 25 rolled around last spring, nothing, it seemed, could draw Lillard and Nurkic closer.

They had become family off the court, and on the court they had developed into one of the most deadly pick-and-roll combinations in the NBA. Nurkic was having a career season and Lillard was in the discussion  for MVP, and they reached those heights playing off each other and their unmistakable bond.

Each knows the other so well that they can detect, without talking, when something is amiss with the other.

“A lot of people don’t recognize when I’m having a bad time,” Lillard  said. “But Nurk, he can tell. It’s weird. He will text me, and his words will be something he observed, and I will be like, ‘Damn, I wasn’t  showing that.’ But that’s how I felt, and he picked up on it. And I can do the same thing with him. I can watch Nurk take 10 steps and see his body language and I’ll be … something is going on.”

But on that March night, that dynamic — the ability for the two to communicate without talking — was about to be put in action in the most heart-wrenching of ways.

In double overtime of their game against Brooklyn, Nurkic’s left leg snapped as he landed after attempting a shot. It was a gruesome sight, one that caused players from the Nets to sprint away, hands over their mouths, and left Blazers teammates staring in disbelief.

Nurkic was rushed to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with compound fractures of the tibia and fibula.

After the game, Lillard could only think about getting to the hospital to see his friend.

“I wasn’t thinking about our team losing a center; I was thinking about him as a friend,” Lillard said.

It was a rushed departure from the arena that night. Lillard arrives at and leaves Blazers games in a sprinter van, and after the game, he and his family loaded into the van and headed home. When they arrived, his family went inside, but Lillard jumped in his car and drove to the hospital. When he arrived, the doctor was in the room going over the next morning’s surgery. The room included Nurkic’s girlfriend, two friends who were visiting and members of the Blazers medical staff.

When the doctor was done, Nurkic and Lillard locked eyes and embraced hands. They didn’t say a word.

“That night, there’s no words,” Nurkic said. “There’s nothing he could say. The thing with Dame, we know when we see each other what it is. So I  didn’t need to hear him say something. It was a look, and that goes very far.”

Lillard says he is not a crier, and he said that night he didn’t shed a tear, but he “felt emotion.”

“It was hard not to after seeing him like that, because he didn’t hide his emotions,” Lillard said. “His face was red, and it looked like he had been crying the whole time, and I just remember driving home, like, damn. It was tough for me. Tough to deal with.”

Lillard said on his drive home, he was lost in thought. He thought about their friendship and how they had become so close and why they were drawn to each other.

“Nurk is like one of the best people I’ve ever met,” Lillard said. “And with his personality, it’s weird, but he’s, like, kind. I don’t know if  generous is the right word, but he is really kind. He has all that shit with him, where he is going to talk slick and have attitude sometimes, but it’s a situation where he is going to show you who he is and how he feels.

“He’s just such a good person, and you can tell by the stuff that bothers him. It’s never a material issue. It’s always a principle issue. Every time he is upset, it’s about something like respect or how he was  treated. He doesn’t hide, he doesn’t pretend, and those are the people you can trust, those are the people you really know who they are.”

The biggest question surrounding the Trail Blazers today is when Nurkic is going to return.

The team has been protective and silent about any timeline or progress with his rehabilitation, but at one point last summer, it was loosely projected that Nurkic could return as soon as late January and probably sometime in February.

He began traveling with the team in December and broke a sweat taking part in a non-contact practice in Phoenix on Dec. 14.

Through it all, Lillard has picked his moments of when to counsel Nurkic, when to encourage him and when to just leave him alone.

“He has just needed an honest voice,” Lillard said. “Somebody once told me, ‘Don’t listen to the loudest voice; listen to the truest.’ So from day one, I’ve been there for him, and he knows I’m always telling him the truth. So I’ve told him, ‘If you think you are being overworked, trust your body. But also understand that when you come back from injury, they are going to work-work-work you.’

“And I’ve also been giving him reassurance. We brought in a whole new guy (Hassan Whiteside) to play center, and he is playing well and doing good things, but I’ve had to reassure him that he is always going to be a part of this. Tell him he is a pillar and that’s not going to change. And he needs to hear that. That’s part of the healing process. You can start to feel uncomfortable about your place, so I’ve been telling him, ‘Come to our practice; be a part of this.’”

Nurkic said for the most part, however, Lillard has given him space during his rehabilitation.

“He understands that he just needs to leave me alone,” Nurkic said.  “Obviously, he has been there for me, talking to me, asking how I’m doing, how he could help. But he also understands this is my time.  Nobody can help me; it has to be me. But being with him the last three years has helped me understand that I need to bring it. There is no excuse for not working. There is no ‘today I’m not going to work.’ I know because of his example.”

As their friendship has grown, so, too, has their summer engagement.

Last summer, the two and their significant others vacationed together in Mexico.

“Just hanging out,” Nurkic said. “You know, enjoy food, movies, exchange the words.”

“More like talk shit,” Lillard said. “I call him out on his little stuff, and he clowns on me. Usually, it’s all just one big joke.”

It reached a head when the Blazers started making a bunch of moves in July. Evan Turner was traded. Al-Farouq Aminu left in free agency. Then Meyers Leonard and Maurice Harkless were traded.

Nervous about the roster movement, Nurkic wanted to talk with Lillard. So he called. And called. And called.

Usually, Lillard says he takes Nurkic’s calls, even at 4 a.m.

“But not every time,” Nurkic said. “He didn’t answer for like a week.  So, I don’t know if this is for media or not, but I texted him, quote by quote: ‘If I’m getting traded, let me know. I don’t want to hear it  from nobody else.’” 

Nurkic threatened to go to Twitter and air his concern. Turns out Lillard was in China at the time, busy on a shoe tour with Adidas. When he finally got Nurkic’s texts, he called.

“He said, ‘You won’t answer your phone, so I’m going to go on Twitter,’” Lillard said, chuckling. “So I called him; he was on a boat. He said, ‘I’m not on the team no more?’ I told him, ‘Nurk, you crazy.’”

“So I told him, ‘OK, we’re friends still,’” Nurkic said.

The two laugh at the memory. They know they and CJ McCollum make up the pillars of the organization, and they know nothing will ever get in the way of their bond.

Lillard calls Nurkic “one of my best friends in the world.” And Nurkic says Lillard is his best friend, “100 percent, yeah. Oh, yeah.”

It is a friendship that, along with McCollum — with whom both are also tight — makes up the pillars that hold up the franchise. It is their trust, their understanding and their commitment to one another that helps solidify the Blazers.

Whether it lasts beyond this summer remains to be seen. Nurkic says he has once again extended an invitation for Lillard to come to his home in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

“That’s 10 times I invite him already,” Nurkic said. “He said this summer he would come.”

“Bro,” Lillard said, shaking his head. “You can’t call me at 4 a.m. and expect me to come. He always invites me last-minute.”

And with that, the two chuckled and slapped hands before turning away, each knowing the other had his back.",nba,Babo and Uncle Nurk: How trust evolved into a friendship...

1.) He’s proven himself to be adaptable. So has had success as a coach in multiple cities, and generally has his teams in Championship Contention. Based on his time in multiple roles (coach, player, broadcaster) - he’s proven himself to be able to helm a variety of obligations

2.) He learns from his mistakes. In the early 2000s, Tim Duncan very nearly chose them Orlando Magic in free agency. Doc made a mistake by not letting his family use the Magic’s private plane. He messed up, but clearly learned from that in his recruitment of Kawhi Leonard to the Clippers. Doc was also effectively GM of the Clippers in the early part of the decade. He clearly wasn’t fit for that role and accepted that he was better as a coach. This level of humility and the ability to learn make him a strong candidate for President of the US because he will inevitably make mistakes.

3.) He’s an excellent delegator and has a strong eye for talent. Tyronn Lue, Tom Thibodeau, etc. Assistants under Doc are effective and often go on to have success post Doc. In order to be successful, Presidents need delegate tasks. If you pick the wrong staff, you’re in trouble. So I trust Doc to pick a highly informed and credentialed staff to help run the executive branch. 

4.) He has a good perspective on world events. His video clip about comparing 2 minutes of kneeling to the murder of George Floyd demonstrated a strong ability to convey messages to the public and understand world events. 

So overall, I think we should write in Doc Rivers this fall instead of Trump or Biden",nba,"I had a dream last night that Doc Rivers was President, and now I think he really should run"

I am a Strength and Conditioning Coach working in professional basketball in one of the smaller European leagues and having completed my masters thesis on load in basketball (happy to verify these to mods) I thought I would make a ~~small~~ fucking long thread about ""load management"" and maybe address some misconceptions about the practice. I hope this doesn't get deleted as I think I can help people understand a little more about what it really means to manage load.

**What is Load?**

Well, load in this sense is essentially a quantification of work done, so how much has an athlete done in that particular session or game or even how much they have done that day, week or month. However, load can be expressed in many different metrics and there are two distinct types of load that need to be understood when ""managing load"". These are **internal load** and **external load**.

**External load**

External load is a generally objective quantification of the work done in a session. So, for example if I were looking to put a number on the external load of my weekly bicep curl session it might be fairly straight forward in

3 x 10 reps = 30 reps

30 reps is a quantification of my external load for that session, though obviously not a very good one given that it doesn't really describe what I've done in that session - so I might up the ante a little:

3 x 10 reps of 10kg = 300kg

300kg is a fair description of the external load of my bicep session and is one often reported in those articles of ""xxxx lifts 38 tonnes per training session"". Though this too isn't a perfect description of my load for that session as it doesn't describe my sets/reps/recovery amongst other things that might differentiate it from another session where I lifted a total of 300kg but you are starting to get the idea.

**External Load in Basketball**

We have all no doubt seen the stats of players' distance covered in soccer/rugby games (gathered by GPS) - this is common practice in most team sports as a basic method of monitoring external load. But it does feel a little bit like the 30 reps of my bicep session because it leaves a lot to the imagination as if I were to go out and run a steady 5km, I would no doubt find it a lot easier than if I went and played 30 minutes of basketball but covered the same distance.

This has now led to the further dissection of GPS data by sports performance teams to include all sorts of metrics such as:

*metres covered at high speeds (14kmh+) or similar*

*accelerations*

*high-speed collisions*

Such actions are determined as high risk for certain injuries in certain sports so are monitored depending on what the performance staff deem important. For sports where hamstring injuries might be commonplace, high speed running metres are almost always monitored.

So, how is external load monitored in basketball?

Well unlike other sports played outside, GPS data is very difficult to collect in basketball. Though there are some very expensive systems such as the Catapult ClearSky which can give indoor GPS data (which I have no doubt NBA teams utilise), players' external load is generally monitored through accelerometer units (with gyroscope/magnetometers) worn in a small vest underneath or built into jerseys.

Accelerometers work to measure change in acceleration of the body across all 3 planes of movement. Whilst output data for accelerometers is a bit of a minefield, practitioners use pre-developed or develop their own algorithms to identify certain movement patterns that might be of interest, such as identifying:

*Quantity of jumps*

*Collisions*

*High speed accelerations*

*High speed decelerations*

Once all of these are accounted for, practitioners can begin to quantify how often athletes might be completing certain (potentially) high risk movements but they are also given a ""Player Load"" number, which is an arbitrary number spat out by the algorithm to quantify the amount of work that player did in that session/game. So, essentially if you moved more around the court and at faster speeds with more high speed actions than your teammate your Player Load data would come out higher.

Well, this all sounds very nice and potentially useful, BUT...

What if, I were invited to go and do a workout with say... Russell Westbrook and the Rockets' S&amp;C. I fly over to Houston and we get started on a little conditioning work - lets say we're on the first set doing some shuttle runs or whatever and we're working on a metronome so me and Russell are doing exactly the same amount of work, we do 5 minutes of 10m, 20m, 30m shuttles and then we stop for a rest.

**I am blowing** I mean I am really dying here, I feel sick and I'm not sure I can do much more...

Then I look over at Russell and of course he's absolutely fine, this is the first set and he's done this a million times.

*But our external load was exactly the same*

So, how good is external load at describing what really happens if there can be such a disparity between people (exaggerated of course). Well, that leads onto the second type of load...

**Internal Load**

Internal load is essentially how a session/game affected the athlete, so what physiological response did the athlete have to the external load of that session.

Going back to mine and Russell Westbrooks little workout, though our external load (indentical metres, speed etc) my heart rate was likely averaging somewhere around 180 across the 5 minutes but Russell's might have been down around 100 for the duration. This (and yes it is obvious) means that different people are affected by similar or the same work loads in different ways.

There are many methods of measuring internal load, such as:

*Heart rate* - Usually averaged across smaller and smaller zones/segments

*Perception of effort* - A very common method is just for athletes to rate the session for difficulty and multiply by the length of the session e.g 8/10 for 60 minutes = 480 (arbitrary unit but gives a figure)

*Blood markers* - Typically research based but quantifying blood lactate as a marker of internal load is common in some endurance sports training.

There are other methods of measuring both external and internal load but there are literally PhDs written on the topics.

**Load Management**

So, with all this in mind if we are trying to ""manage the load"" of a player, what is it we are actually interested in?

Well, basketball teams looking to properly implement load management will have rigorous testing and monitoring protocols in place whereby players like have their external load monitored (through either GPS or accelerometer data) which is coupled with a continued monitoring of their internal response to that load, so if I was to guess (and it is a guess) what players are probably monitored on it would be this:

*External Load:*

- GPS or Accel data for all drills, sessions, scrimmages. Essentially everything court-based

*Internal Load:*

- Heartrate monitoring through court-based activity

- Perception of sessions/days exertion

- Monitoring of wellness/sleep habits (how do you feel, do you feel ready to play today on scales of 1-10 etc)

- Some sort of physical profiling each day/each session of key selected physical outputs. For example in rugby clubs I worked at in the past we monitored adductor strength capacity before every session and though these might not quantify the direct load from a single session they can indicate residual fatigue from cumulative sessions.

I fully expect that some NBA teams will do a lot more than this but it also wouldn't surprise me if some do a lot less - it really depends on the medical/performance staff and their preferences. However, we have all this nice regular data coming from players so how do we use it to ""manage their load""...

It is worth mentioning that naturally external and internal load hold a close relationship whereby external load will impact internal load and though it might be internal load (the response of the athlete) that we are most interested in regarding protecting the player and trying to reduce the chance they injure themselves, it is adjustment of external load that allows us to do that.

**Chronic vs Acute Load**

So, as a preface I am sure there are people on this sub who are interested in this sort of thing and will potentially be quick to call me out on using this, however I use it only as an example for the application of load management and I have no doubt that different clubs and practitioners follow different guidelines/principles.

Chronic load refers to a culmination of a players' last 4 (or more or less, you get the idea) weeks training/playing load and will likely be an average of those four weeks, so as an example using the PlayerLoad figure spat out by our accelerometers across training and games, my players weekly load for the past four weeks might look like this:

**Week 1 - 300au** (arbitrary units)

**Week 2 - 350au**

**Week 3 - 330au**

**Week 4 - 350au**

So my players' chronic training load is 332.50au. This figure is important because it gives a guideline to performance staff as to how much external load my player can handle without increasing their risk of injury. To clarify, there is a wealth of published data across a variety of sports that having spikes in *acute load* greater than ~50% of an athletes' chronic load leads to a higher risk of injury occurring. 

**acute load is just the players load for the current or upcoming week**

So, chronic load data can be thought of as essentially a measurement of fitness or how much that athlete has been doing in recent weeks and generally performance staff are reluctant to allow spikes in player load data because it potentially increases risk of injury.

Now, I have seen many comments on posts, particularly about Zion, saying things like

**Why are they managing load when they've just had 3 months off**

**I can't wait for the bubble where every team is fresh**

and many other things similarly misunderstanding how managing load works.

I hope it is clear that load management is important based on the players' previous x number of weeks training/their response to that training and performance staff will have good ideas of the chronic loads of their players and thus how much they are willing to risk exposing them to.

The lockdown is an odd one because although yes players will have been training and doing work, there has likely been huge variation in what players have been able to do prior to their training camps/going into the bubble and many players may still be easing up their load to play full games (think preseason).

**Some other points that might be worth mentioning:**

NBA season fixture congestion is unlike anything else and though professional teams across smaller leagues where games are typically friday-sunday might opt to taper and reduce load during training for their high minute players, this is likely impossible for NBA teams playing upto 4 games per week so load management during games is almost crucial in the modern game to not only reduce injury risk from spikes but also, and often not spoken about, it **allows team to train at high intensities and make the most of the mid-week sessions they get**.

This was initially intended as a small post and I have undoubtedly missed things and been unclear on some areas so feel free to ask any questions - I hope this doesn't get deleted.",nba,An unintentionally long post about load and load management in basketball.

I've seen several sources report Anthony Edwards wingspan to be 6'9"" and some others say 6'11"". I know it isn't a huge difference, but I believe it is important to figure out whether he will be able to slot in at SF and guard them effectively. I know he has a guards skillset but if his body works at the 3 then I reckon he could play a lot there, like PG did in OKC. The longer wingspan make up for his 6'5"" height is he was to play SF and his 225lbs body would be able to handle the extra strength needed for the position. 

**Who thinks it is 6'11""?**

Mike Schmitz from ESPN recently said in a video he has a near 7-foot wingspan, making me think he believes it is 6'11"". He seems to be a reliable source to me too. I've seen the NBA website say it is 6'10"" but they also have his height at 6'3"" so don't really trust that.

For instance, wouldn't it be great to know that Kendrick Perkins actually is above average with his predictions being correct than say, Stephen A Smith? 

This is what I propose: Every TV personality would have stats on predictions/takes. Only takes that can be clearly verified and objective would be included. You could also separate the takes based on a conventional viewpoint vs a non-convential view. So if one TV person says Giannis is going to win MVP this year, its not in the same category as saying Harden with win.

3645,CleanSnchz,1596754293,3,1,"So this bubble has shown the true potential of a no-filler team league. Just day-in day-out competitive basketball. What if it was always like this?

One way this may be done is split the league into more competitive and less competitive halves*. The top half would compete for playoff berth and to avoid relegation. Bottom half teams would compete for promotion to the top half and would have lottery priority. Teams within halves would compete more often. Similar to how divisions (which currently do basically nothing) create more games among teams.

Is this an absolutely shit idea? And why is this such a shit idea?

He could take over a young team of tough players. He’d have a 2nd star in Butler and a 3rd in Bam. Nobody would look down on him for joining them. This is his best option 

2. Dallas Mavericks 

Dallas has good weather, but less in the way of nightlife. Texas doesn’t have an income tax. 

He would be taking over a team with Doncic at the helm and a third star in KP. This may not be easy depending on how good they are by 2021. They have a decent supporting cast. 

3. Toronto Raptors 

Toronto doesn’t have good weather, but it has an excellent nightlife. The taxes are higher 

He would be taking over a team with an excellent supporting cast that’s gone deep in the playoffs. If he loses to them this year, going there may look bad 

Wildcards: 

Golden State, depending on how good Curry and Klay next year. 

Milwaukee if they’re successful between now and free agency. 

Knicks if they look good",nba,"Miami, Dallas or Toronto: Where will Giannis go in Free Agency?"

* Phoenix has a winnable ending to the bubble (Miami, Philly, OKC, Dallas)

* Memphis has a tough closing schedule (OKC, Toronto, Boston, Milwaukee) 

I could easily see Memphis losing 3/4 games and possibly losing 4/4. That would put them finishing 33-41 or 32-41. Portland I imagine goes 2-3 or 3-2 meaning they finish 33-41 or 34-40. In these scenarios Memphis is surpassed by Portland who will most likely hold the tie breaker (higher conference winning %).

3716,N0_More_ideas,1596841779,35,1,"So, now that we're like halfway through the irregular season, may as well leave some guesses as to how the thing'll shape out.

While there's still time for things to change, I think we've seen enough to get a clear picture of how the West's seeding will end up. Here's my prediction:

1. LA Lakers
2. LA Clippers
3. Houston Rockets
4. Denver Nuggets
5. Oklahoma City Thunder
6. Utah Jazz
7. Dallas Mavericks
8. Portland Trailblazers
9. Memphis Grizzlies
10. San Antonio Spurs
11. Phoenix Suns
12. New Orleans Pelicans
13. Sacremento Kings

Don't imagine that's too outlandish. Biggest cause of contention's probably Houston at 3, but considering they only have Sacremento, San Antonio, Indiana, and Philly left, it's honestly pretty plausible that they go 4-0, which would put them in the 3rd seed assuming Denver loses at least 2 - which I think they will, since they have the Raptors, Lakers, and Clippers.

OKC beats Utah because I think Utah's losing 2 more games - Denver and Dallas probs - which'd tie them with OKC if they lose 2 - Heat and Clippers - and OKC won the season series.

Portland beats Memphis because their schedule's easier. Memphis holds on to the 9 seed because I'm pretty sure they'll win at least 1 more game.

So. Thoughts? Your own predictions?",nba,Western Conference Predictions

3747,nwhalen9021,1596838801,0,1,Safe to say that this isn't the best offensive performance in OKC history,nba,At the end of the first quarter the Thunder had 37 points. From the beginning of the second to the point where they subbed out the starters (5:00 left in the 4th) they put up 36 points
3748,BliqPentha,1596838674,43,1,"In 2017, the Wolves decided to give Wiggins a 5 year max contract. This went strongly against how advanced metrics valued Wiggins at the time. 

1 year later, Jimmy Butler was getting paid only $20m, and the Wolves weren't able to give him a raise. They were a top ~3 team in the West when healthy, but they couldn't reward the key player who made it happen. 

Butler was rightly pissed - the team chose to use it's cap space to max Wiggins rather just giving Butler the max. 

This led to the team imploding. Most notably with Butler screaming ""You f***ing need me! You can't win without me!"" at the team's GM. He took out his anger on the court and dominated that gym in every way. Butler delivered a tour de force. 

Butler/KAT with a bunch of scrubs was a top ~3 team in the West.

This is not a new topic here I know, but I was wondering, in light of recent bubble evidence, between AD, Embiid, and Jokic, who do you think has the highest ceiling among the three if they all stay healthy? I'm personally torn between Embiid and AD, though I get the Jokic contingent. The guy's an incredibly unique talent, and easily had a 2nd team all NBA season.

For me personally, I feel like Embiid and AD's almost Gobert level defense (at least according to a small perusing of defensive stats on bball reference, Zach Lowe and other pretty credible basketball people) and obviously efficient enough brand of high volume offense, especially with Embiid's apparent recent improvement in double team passing, outweigh Jokic's unique offense running-passing ability. I just cannot see AD or Embiid in Jokic's place on last season's Nuggets team, losing in the playoffs to a Blazer's team who's best big man was a one armed and fasting (and already not great defensively) Enes Kanter. While he's not a sieve, I wonder if Jokic's defense is good enough to definitely put him in the top 2 or 1 big men conversation. And with the rise of Jusuf ""apparently now a bigger prime Draymond Green who scores more"" Nurkic,  Jokic's place in the top 3 could be in question. Okay that last point was a joke, but Nurkic has been playing at essentially an all star level so yay for that guy.",nba,Highest Ceiling in Top 3 Big Men?

However, while i don't think this year's draft is necessarily great, I don't think it's without talent. I don't think this draft is filled with people who will be out of the league in two years. Here are a couple of players I think could do something in the nba, with ideal landing spots. I tried to pick players likely to go in the lottery that aren't talked about as much, which really just means I'm not talking about Lamelo, Wiseman, Anthony Edwards, and Cole Anthony. I honestly think the guys I picked have a chance to be the best players in the draft when we look back though. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Tyrese Haliburton: Guard, Iowa State

Honestly, i think this guy is actually getting more buzz recently, so this might not be the hottest take. He's a 6'5 point guard who has playmaking ability and has shown to be a pretty great defender. It's not flashy, his numbers aren't eye popping, but his advanced numbers get pretty crazy. There's a Jonathan Tjarks article on the Ringer from earlier this year that puts a lot of his numbers in perspective. He isn't going to be some scoring machine but his playmaking and efficiency is to die for. 4-1 assists to turnovers, with high efficiency. He is, in my opinion, the best passer and playmaker in the draft this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest flaw in his game is that he needs to bulk up. 175 pounds at 6'5 just sounds delicate. The other thing and this may just be me, but off the ball on offense his lack of speed really seems to hurt him. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Ideal landing spots: 

**Atlanta Hawks:** 

this might seem like a pretty unsexy pick considering how high the Hawks are likely to pick, fans probably want one of the more hyped players in the draft. However, I think being able to have a great crafty playmaker who plays high iq basketball to go in with Trae and be in a rotation with the athletic(and constantly improving) cam reddish and Deandre Hunter gives the hawks a lot of flexibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Chicago Bulls**

Honestly this would be my top landing spot for him. There are so many weapons on that bulls roster. The Bulls would have a guard rotation that has everything. they'd get to have another primary playmaker and not force everything on Lavine. They'd have a great defensive guard they could play with Kris Dunn, and they'd be able to pair Haliburton with Coby White who is one of the most athletic point guards right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Knicks**

Honestly, kid just feels like he was made for Thibs. I don't have much more to say. this one's more a gut feeling admittedly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Charlotte Hornets**

Ok, so the Hornets have a lot of needs and are counting on a lot of young players already to develop. If they could get a great, smart playmaker next to their first team all BDE guard rotation of scary Terry and Devonte Graham. Guards probably don't seem high on their list and they probably want a big, but a great playmaker could really help them utilize Devonte Graham's shooting. It's a stretch but it'd be something good for them.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Minnesota Timber Wolves**

Hey, if Culver lives up to what he showed going into the draft as a ball handler and playmaker who can make smart reads and scramble defenses. Haliburton and him together would be great compliments to D'lo and KAT. You'd be losing a lot of speed running them together and that ain't good, but honestly, you'd have guys who can be crafty on the drive and free up room for Kat and D'lo. also a guy who can drive and kick the ball out to one of those two. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok That was longer than I thought. Also I didn't put the warriors down because I think it'd just be terrifying. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Devin Vassell, Wing, Florida State

Honestly, the fact that there's an elite defender in this draft who is 6'7 with a 6'10 wingspan and can guard at least 3 positions is what makes me feel like we're sleeping too hard on this draft. I absolutely love this kid. Excellent help defense. insane anticipation. He's a fast player and should be a dream for coaches. He has great passing vision, has shown improvement year to year going off the dribble, and has excellent court vision. I honestly think the kid is a steal, he  probably should go in the top 5 but might not go top 10.  if there was more of a spotlight on him. He has quickly improved his shooting game, and is improving as a ball handler. Honestly, this kid's potential could be higher than people give credit for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest weakness is that it's pretty clear the kid needs to get in the weight room. You can find the same note on multiple scouting reports that he needs to get better at finishing through contact. He is improving so fast though I wouldn't doubt this guy becomes the steal of the draft.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Ideal Landing spots

**Memphis Grizzlies** 

I'm sorry, I'm assuming Portland makes the playoffs if only for some truly terrible injury luck in Memphis. However, if Memphis gets Vassell, they'd have Ja, Vassell, Clarke, and J3 in the last three drafts. That is a line up you could keep together for the foreseeable future and just roll with into the future and watch develop. He is such a memphis pick. add in Justise Winslow and jesus christ that team is scary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, the Grizzlies might even want to trade up a few spots to get him. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Washington Wizards** 

Ok so this is tough. There isn't a lot to look forward to with the Wizards roster. HOWEVER, this would put another high potential player next to Rui, and they'd fit together pretty nicely too. I know there isn't much to get excited or write home about, but getting those two together and letting them develop could be really solid. Plus, he'd probably be their best defender his rookie season. 

&amp;#x200B;

**San Antonio Spurs**

I honestly think this is a very Spurs-y pick. They have a need at Wing, and having a strong defensive wing to go along with their current collection of guards would be great. Think this is the spot where he can develop. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Phoenix Suns**

I'm honestly on the Suns going to the playoffs train as they just kicked my team's ass. But I think if Portland is able to clinch it, an elite playmaker like Rubio, one of the best shooters like Booker, a very very promising Big in Ayton, Cameron Johnson who has been very impressive, Kelly Oubre, and Devin Vassell would be terrifying to play against. Like the Grizzlies, if I was the GM in Phoenix I'd trade up for this. Speaking of which...

&amp;#x200B;

**OKC Thunder**

Not a lottery team but, in a draft where so many teams will be looking to trade down, they will always have the best offer without really giving up too much to get to picks 8-12 to get him. Vassell fits perfectly next to SGA, CP3, and Danilo. He will fit right into a rotation with those players and gives them a great defensive wing for the post-CP3 future.

3826,KawhiMeARivers,1596928408,65,1,"Before Friday night, Siakam had only played in one of the Raptors’ prior three games against the Celtics this season. That was on Oct. 25, the second game of Toronto’s season, when Siakam erupted for 33 points in a close loss. He scored efficiently in that game, with a 66.7 TS%, aided mainly by his 5-for-7 shooting from beyond the arc (remember, this was the game when Siakam first showcased his above-the-break three consistently).

Still, Siakam shot only 40% from inside the arc (6-for-15) in that game, compared to his 49.9% inside the arc for the season. Friday night, Siakam shot 40% again, making just four of his 10 two-point attempts.

The Celtics’ switchable defensive wing trio of Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Gordon Hayward were able to stifle him. These three, and particularly Brown, are equipped to make life difficult for Siakam. Let’s look at the different ways he tried to score on them Friday night, why he struggled so much, and how they managed to bother him.

# Post-ups

Look at how Jaylen Brown bumps Siakam out of his desired positioning:

[https://streamable.com/9sg7l1](https://streamable.com/9sg7l1)

Siakam prefers to spin baseline over his left shoulder there. Instead, he steps back into a tough, contested one-legged fadeaway.

In another first-half example, Brown chases Siakam around a screen (which is hard to see from the angle given) and gets his body into Siakam again. Brown makes him uncomfortable, with one hand on Siakam’s back (legal post guarding position). Siakam loses his balance a bit, shuffles his feet and travels.

[https://streamable.com/1et2lo](https://streamable.com/1et2lo)

On a different possession, Siakam works from the opposite block. This allows him to go to his strong hand down the middle of the lane. He misses this one, with a good contest by Brown, but this is a higher-percentage attempt:

[https://streamable.com/pcq3j0](https://streamable.com/pcq3j0)

In the second half, Siakam again finds himself on the left block, going middle. Brown bodies him up and forces him to take a relatively tough shot, but Siakam’s uses his body to shield the ball and has nice touch on the floater:

[https://streamable.com/7plqyy](https://streamable.com/7plqyy)

Siakam makes it because he’s extremely skilled, but still, it’s not exactly an ideal shot for the Raptors. The positive here is that he got deeper post position before the catch, something that’s crucial when going against Brown, who holds his ground pretty well when Siakam tries to back him down.

It’s rare that Siakam is able to back down against Brown in the post. Even then, Brown has long arms and the height to challenge Siakam on the shot. The only time Siakam really backs him down in the post is on the first possession of the third quarter. Siakam uses a clever pump-fake off the drop-step, then goes up-and-under for the easy finish:

[https://streamable.com/5umfbk](https://streamable.com/5umfbk)

Later in that quarter, Siakam catches the ball deeper. He again spins to his left here, which allows him to shake Brown and turn away from the Celtics’ help defenders:

[https://streamable.com/ryi4w4](https://streamable.com/ryi4w4)

It’s much easier for Siakam when he catches the ball deeper and touches the paint, rather than the midrange/baseline area where he has to dribble more off the catch, just to get near the basket. Brown is strong enough to hold his ground against Siakam dribbling; Siakam needs to get better positioning before he even takes a bounce.

# Perimeter attacks

When Siakam wasn’t operating in the post, the other main way he looked to score Friday night was off the dribble, usually starting well outside the three-point line.

After his early post-ups were unsuccessful, Siakam tries to take Tatum off the dribble from the top. Marcus Smart lunges but doesn’t commit enough for Siakam to feel comfortable kicking it to Norman Powell in the corner. The rest of the defenders stay put, and Tatum stays in front of Siakam and forces him to take a contested runner with only one foot in the paint:

[https://streamable.com/965wc8](https://streamable.com/965wc8)

Later in the quarter, Siakam tries to attack Hayward from a similar spot. Hayward stays in front of him, and Siakam starts to lose the ball, which Brad Wanamaker promptly swipes:

[https://streamable.com/cfdduu](https://streamable.com/cfdduu)

Siakam commits a frustration foul afterward.

In the second quarter, Siakam catches the ball in another late-clock scenario. This time, he attacks Brown to the middle, going left but taking a floater with his right hand:

[https://streamable.com/ru21dt](https://streamable.com/ru21dt)

Siakam makes it, but this was a really tough shot. When he tries a similar drive against Tatum later in the quarter, Tatum holds his ground. Siakam misses that one, and it’s pretty clear at that point — with the Raptors down by 18 — that he was, understandably, forcing the issue.

## Pick-and-rolls?

Ah, here’s what’s been missing. Where has the patented Siakam-Lowry pick-and-roll gone? What about Siakam-Gasol?

As Louis Zatzman [wrote for Raptors Republic](https://www.raptorsrepublic.com/2020/07/13/in-lowry-and-siakam-do-the-raptors-have-a-secret-weapon-saved-for-the-playoffs/), the Siakam-Lowry “inverted” pick-and-roll, where Lowry screens for Siakam, has been incredibly effective this season. Gasol is the Raptors’ biggest and best screener, and it makes sense to try to get Theis switched onto Siakam. While Theis is a good defender in this own right, he’s still the only defender in the Celtics’ top-six rotation players whose footspeed truly can’t match Siakam’s.

So, where have these Siakam-led pick-and-rolls been? As Yasmin of the Dishes &amp; Dimes Podcast [points out](https://twitter.com/carmelohdrama/status/1292128865104670723), only VanVleet and Ibaka screened for him — not Lowry and Gasol.

We finally see one here in the third quarter, where VanVleet, guarded by Kemba Walker, screens for Siakam:

[https://streamable.com/u84xjb](https://streamable.com/u84xjb)

Walker hedges at Siakam, then quickly sprints back to check VanVleet. Brown recovers, rendering the pick ineffective. Perhaps at another time, Siakam would’ve hit VanVleet with a quick pass in that sliver of daylight that he had when Walker was sprinting, but Siakam looked pretty determined to get his own at this point.

Brown, fully in front of Siakam after the screen, mirrors him perfectly. Siakam can’t go anywhere, and spins into an off-balance shot, with Brown draped all over him.

Later in the quarter, Siakam spins out of control into Theis, in the rare Siakam-Ibaka pick-and-roll, and flings up a prayer:

[https://streamable.com/hu30kf](https://streamable.com/hu30kf)

We can chalk that one up to the situation; it was a 27-point game, and the Raptors were entirely deflated by that point.

The point remains: The Raptors need to make good use of Siakam as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, and perhaps a screener. If they can get Walker switched onto Siakam in the post, it would give Siakam a major size and strength there, which is a rarity against Boston’s plethora of stout defensive wings.

Nick Nurse likes to hold his cards close to his chest. Don’t be surprised to see the Siakam-Lowry and Siakam-Gasol pick-and-rolls unleashed in a potential playoff series, because they sure weren’t on Friday night.

## Finally: Shooting

It would be disingenuous to point out all of Siakam’s struggles in this game without mentioning his shooting. On re-watch his five 3-point attempts, they were all fine shots. Quite frankly, you just miss sometimes.

Siakam went 8-for-18 (44.4 percent) from beyond the arc in Toronto’s first three games in the bubble, whereas he shot just for 1-for-5 against Boston. That part wasn’t some special defense by the Celtics; at times, they even dared Siakam to shoot it, even [leaving him wide open in the corner](https://stats.nba.com/events/?flag=1&amp;GameID=0021901279&amp;GameEventID=264&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;title=MISS%20Siakam%20%203PT%20Jump%20Shot&amp;sct=plot) at least once.

As former Raptors coach Dwane Casey loves to say, “It’s a make or miss league.” More than that, though, Siakam’s 3-point shooting opens up everything else. Particularly if he can make some pull-ups off the dribble, it’ll force Brown and Tatum to play him a little tighter up top, and maybe force them to go over screens (with Lowry and Gasol presumably setting some).

If the shot is falling, that opens everything up — both for Siakam, and for the rest of the Raptors.",nba,[OC] How the Celtics’ wings stifled Siakam last night

3840,IvvyX,1596927682,11,1,"I was doing my daily arguing on here a bit ago and was thinking. DEF Rating is a good stat but it's missing something. It's missing the full value of steals and Blocks. A Steal/Block that turns into points to be exact. In Drating a steal or block is valued as the same as a miss. Now most of the time I could see a steal/block being literally the same as a miss outside of one area and that's when a steal/block leads to fast break points. This isn't something Drating considers when doing the calc all Drating does is tell you how good your team is against letting up points but defense isn't just about not letting up points. 

Things like turnover forcing fouls on defense that lead you to getting free throws, things like steals that lead to fast breaks or blocks aswell. The Idea would be anytime a steal/block that leads to a basket within 6-8 seconds or a foul(against you) while you're defending that leads to freethrows(aka techs or fouls over the limit) I wouldn't count a miss that gets the ball pushed up fast as most of the time that's an offensive play it's not quite the same as a defensive play that leads to buckets. It's kinda like in football I'd count a pick six or fumble recovery taken to the house as a defensive play but I wouldn't credit my defense for a punt return.",nba,There should be a stat that tracks steals/blocks that turn into points(details inside)

Zion has a total Plus/minus of -58 in the 5 games played in the bubble so far. So that's an average +/- of -11.6 per game. And he did this while averaging only 20 minutes per game. (20 minutes and 41 seconds to be exact).

The Pelicans have a positive +/- when Zion is not on the court (A total of +19) in these 5 games but when Zion is on the court, the teams' +/- completely sinks. And Zion isn't really on the court much (only 20 mpg).

According to [Shakeemah Simmons-Winter](https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2020/08/nba-western-conference-play-in-game-to-air-on-abc-saturday-aug-15/)  of ESPN, ABC will air the first game between the Nos. 8 and 9 seeds on  Saturday at 2:30 p.m. ET. If the No. 8 seed wins, it will advance to the  playoffs to face the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers. 

However,  there will be a second game Sunday if the No. 9 seed wins, which ESPN  will air at 4:30 p.m. ET. If there is a second game, it will be a  winner-take-all affair for that last postseason spot.

While  there have been plenty of intriguing storylines at Walt Disney World  Resort during the seeding games, including the emergence of T.J. Warren,  the battle for LA between the Lakers and Clippers and teams battling  for positioning in the standings, the race for the Western Conference's  final playoff spot looms as the biggest.

The Memphis Grizzlies have seen their grip on the No. 8 seed collapse with a 1-5 record through six games in Florida.

They  are just one game ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers and three or less  games ahead of the Phoenix Suns, San Antonio Spurs, New Orleans  Pelicans and Sacramento Kings. Entering the league's restart, the rule  was put in place the No. 9 seed had to be within four games of the No. 8  seed to force the play-in tournament following eight seeding games for  each team.

That means the race for the No. 9  seed is just as important with so many teams still alive with a handful  of games remaining. Only one can challenge the eventual No. 8 seed for  that final spot.

Portland would pose a challenge to the Lakers in the first round with a dynamic backcourt of [Damian Lillard](http://bleacherreport.com/damian-lillard), CJ McCollum and Gary Trent Jr. to go with a healthier frontcourt featuring Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins.

New  Orleans has Zion Williamson, San Antonio has a pedigree of success and  Sacramento has plenty of young playmakers who figure to challenge in the  West in the years to come. Then there is Phoenix, who is yet to lose a  game in Florida at 5-0 with Devin Booker leading the way as an elite  scorer who can take over at a moment's notice.

Ja  Morant and the Grizzlies may have to face any one of these threats, and  that is assuming they don't completely fall out of the No. 8 or 9 seed  with continued struggles.",nba,[b/r] NBA Announces Western Conference Playoff Play-In Game Schedule

4030,EricHangingOut,1597099862,19,1,"The Suns have won six straight in The Bubble, which will likely lead to an off-season of playoff expectations for next season and Booker in the discussion as an All-NBA first or second team player. But look at the fucking field in the West!

Lakers - LeBron James and Anthony David returning. They will be a destination for buy-out guys and ring-hunting vets.

Clippers - The entire core returning, assuming they bring back Harrell. They will be a destination for buy-out guys and ring-hunting vets.

Nuggets - Jokic will be another year further into his prime, MPJ should continue to develop and ascend, Gary Harris will be 26, and Jamal Murray 24. They'll have the flexibility to make a huge trade if they're willing to sell high on Porter Jr.

Rockets - Harden and Westbrook should still be near their primes. Tucker, Gordon and Covington are under contract. Morey is excellent at finding contributing talent at bargain prices.

Thunder - Given their long-term strategy and forecasting, Presti will probably see the value in tanking next season in a this competitive field. CP3 showed he still can lead a fringe-contender and Adams and Schroeder might be able to command late-firsts as high-level role players on expiring contracts. 

Jazz - With an aging core and the friction with Gobert before a contract year, I can see them trading Rudy for whatever they can get and re-tooling around Mitchell. Given their performance in the bubble, they're a likely team to drop off out of the playoff field, but they'll still have talent and continuity. 

Mavs - Returning their whole squad, KP another year removed from ACL surgery, Luka's God-like ascent, and a lot of flexibility with mid-sized contracts and Hardaway expiring to make big moves. Look for them to be on the hunt for another superstar before Luka's rookie deal is up.

Grizz - They have injury concerns surrounding JJJ and Justise, but assuming those dudes come back healthy, they'll be well-balanced, have further continuity, JV in his prime, and Morant primed for a sophomore-leap. They also have lots of good players on mid-sized deals and should look to add a superstar at some point before Morant gets a max. But they have three years for that and will probably continue to build organically, but they are already way ahead of schedule.

Blazers - Dame, CJ, Nurk healthy, Gary Trent and Simons improving. I imagine more of the same that we have seen from them the last half-decade.

Spurs - DD, LA, Gay, and Mills expiring. Like the Thunder, this should be a year to turn it over to the young guys, gather some assets, and plan for the future.

Suns - Book, Ayton, and Rubio coming back. They have some flexibility with Oubre's and Kaminsky's expiring contracts to clear the room for a big free agent. It's a pretty weak class, but they can pretty easily bring in talent with their flexibility.

Pelicans - Despite a disappoint Bubble performance, there will be high expectations for Ingram and Zion to become legitimate All-Stars. Will be interesting to see how they build around them, if they trade Jrue for youth, how Lonzo fits in, if guys will want to come there to play with BI and Zion, etc... Will be a massive disappointment if they don't make the playoffs.

Kings - Will depend a lot on Bagley's health and if they bring back Bogdan. But Hield is at the top of his game on a declining contract, Holmes is a steal, and Fox should continue to develop into one of the league's best young point guards. They disappointed this year, but they have a lot of young talent and energy.

Timberwolves - Hopefully KAT and Russell will be energized playing with each other. They have good rotation pieces like Okogie, Culver and Beasley, including to bring some defense that their stars are lacking in. They have James Johnsons' expiring to play with. Expecting an absolutely monster, Top-5 MVP voting year for KAT.

4188,rammypastrami,1597181987,48,0,"I’ve had this hot take for a while and my friend made a post earlier today to ask everyone and prove I was wrong, so here is my entire argument. 

Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/i7z24k/will\_damian\_lillard\_go\_down\_as\_the\_3rd\_greatest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/i7z24k/will_damian_lillard_go_down_as_the_3rd_greatest/)

TL;DR:

3pt% on its own is not good enough to justify the greatness of a shooter on its own. Lillard should go down as the 3rd greatest shooter ever behind Steph and Klay because of the volume he makes them at, the difficulty of his shots, memorable moments, and value his ability brings to a team’s offense. 

Full Post:

I think that Damian Lillard should end up being the 3rd greatest 3pt shooter of all time based on a combination of the volume at which he makes them and the value that his specific skill set adds to his 3pt shooting. For many of the same reasons, I have James Harden in my top 10 too. 

Current Top 10 3pt shooters ever

1. Steph
2. Klay
3. Ray Allen
4. Kyle Korver
5. Steve Nash
6. JJ Reddick
7. Reggie Miller
8. Steve Kerr
9. Damian Lillard
10. James Harden

It may seem like a pretty controversial list that has some potentially missing names (Peja Stojakovic, Dirk, Bird, Jason Terry, Mike Miller, Dale Elis, etc), but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say Lillard can climb up this list. Along with pure shooting prowess, if you factor in the volume of 3s and the value it provides to a team’s offense into how you rank individuals, I think Lillard’s shooting will be seen as much more valuable. 

I feel like people have a lot of NBA discussions today and some are unwilling to look at how the game changes over time and what is now considered valuable. Lillard takes and makes a lot more 3s than several other all-time greats. Additionally, the shots he makes are much more difficult than those traditional shooters since he has to create his own shot off the dribble, which I believe is much more valuable for a team’s offense. If Lillard’s role was to make catch and shoot 3s he’d definitely shoot a higher percentage, but his value comes from being a shot creator who is an incredible floor stretcher. Given all this, it is more impressive that he still is shooting 37%. 

Similar to Steph and Harden, Lillard’s 3pt shooting is a huge part of his team’s offense. Unlike Harden though, Lillard does not play in a system like D’Antoni’s, so I think he would be able to keep up this shooting on any team in the NBA, whereas Harden might have to dial it back a bit because it would be detrimental on another team's offense. Curry is the best shooter ever and it’s not even close, but Lillard is essentially a B+ version. He has made some incredible clutch 3s when it matters most (shots over Houston and OKC) and will only continue to add to that legacy.

There might be plenty of players who have a higher 3pt percentage than Lillard, but his consistency paired with the volume outweigh the differences in shooting percentage other players may have over him. Although there are other players who could potentially replicate Lillard’s volume and produce similar numbers, the fact of the matter is that there aren’t many others and that goes to show how difficult it is to keep up this level of shooting. **After his career is over, if he is able to maintain or increase his percentage, I think that the sheer volume of 3s he makes, the difficulty of his shots, and the spectacle he can put on with his shooting range and clutch factor will make him the 3rd greatest shooter of all time.**",nba,Damian Lillard - 3rd greatest shooter of all time?

All their current team wants in exchange are 1-3  firsts(depending on player and contract length), anywhere between the 2020 draft and the 2026 draft. They'll take any contract from you that makes it work. The trade still has to be at least *possible* if not probable. So that means you can't trade draft picks you don't have or can't trade. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The players**(note I tried to list average salary for the length of their contracts going into 2020-2021, i may or may not have gotten the numbers slightly off, if so, apologies):

2. **Blake Griffin** (2 years, 34.4 million)
3. **Nikola Vucevic** (3 years 28 million, also will definitely cost you more than one future first round pick)
4. **Jrue Holiday (**2 years, 26.3 million) 
5. **Buddy Hield** (23.5 million for 4 years, correct me if I’m wrong on that) 
6. **Aaron Gordon** (2 years, 19.9 million)
7. **Zach Lavine** (2 years, 19.5 million)
8. **Jonas Valanciunas** (2 years, 16 milion for 2 years) 
9. **Dejounte Murray** (4 years, 15.9 million dollars)
10. **Will Barton** (4 years 12.8 million)

**Also to avoid confusion, here are the ""levels"" mentioned in the title: A team would need to go ""up"" one level from where they are now** 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Undisputed best team:** Bubble Suns 
2. **Finals favorite but not the undisputed finals favorite(expected 1-2 seed):**  Lakers, Bucks, Clippers
3. **Teams that clearly expected to be top 4-7 in the whole league(Could be 2 seed, but would be disappointing if they got anything less then the 4 seed) :** Raptors, 2021 nets (with KD and Kyrie healthy), Rockets,  Probably(Maybe?) 2021 Warriors(perhaps?), Philadelphia 76ers  
4. **Teams that will clearly make the playoffs, and are already improving at an alarming rate(These teams should expect to make the playoffs every year regardless, likely 4-7 seeds):** Pacers, Thunder, Portland 2021, Miami, Celtics, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavs, Nuggets
5. **Should be in hot competition for the 8 seed:** actual Suns, San Antonio Spurs, NOLA Pelicans, Orlando Magic, Kings, Grizzlies(sorry, you guys probably should be up a level), Hawks? Timberwolves? Wizards?

&amp;#x200B;

Ben Simmons injured and out indefinitely. Nets missing a lot of key players but playing solid and winning games. I just think it's fucking funny how the Lakers haven't been hit with any woes. That's a little sus to me. It's all just a coincidence huh? 

It's funny how a lot of these mishaps have happened to the Lakers and Lebron's biggest threats. The Blazers are a potential 1st round matchup and what do you know, CJ McCollum gets hurt. TJ Warren and the Pacers (a threat to Lebron's legacy and status as an NBA player) are a potential matchup for the Lakers in the finals - and now I'm hearing Warren got the same injury as Sabonis now? (this really fucking pisses me off the fucking most, MVP of the Bubble and he gets taken out just as he is beginning to take the league by storm) Then you have the Clippers, (a threat to the Lakers in the battle of LA) who haven't been able to play their full roster in a game together. I'm not gonna keep going on about the other stuff but you get the point.

There's just no fucking way all this is a coincidence. I wouldn't put it past me to believe that Lebron is ordering hits on his opponents. That's what he does when he doesn't get his way right? Always making up excuses and buying his way out of his shortcomings. Adam Silver is definitely in on it too. You can't make this shit up. Gotta get the money and ratings up right?

So if they miss it this season, which franchise do you think will be the next to have a massive playoff streak? Currently the other teams with the longest streaks are the Rockets (8), Blazers (7 if they make it this season), Raptors (7), and the Celtics (6). 

I'd vote for the **Raptors**. Already have a good streak going. They arguably have the #1 front office via Masai and the #1 coaching staff via Nick Nurse. Neither seems like they're going anywhere. Stars come and go but you don't need stars to make the playoffs. Especially when you have Masai pulling g-leaguers out his ass on the regular. 

**Celtics** also have a shout with Brad Stevens, Danny Ainge, and a younger franchise cornerstone than the Raps in Tatum. They have a good track record; building a 1-seed team with Isaiah Thomas as the go-to star is damn impressive. 

**Rockets** deserve an honorable mention. The last time they were sub 0.500 was in 2006, but unfortunately they're in the West so they have less leeway. But the Rockets have done a remarkable job staying afloat. Never had to bottom out to transition from Yao-Tmac to Harden. I really believe in Morey and D'Antoni and their optimized system can make a team greater than the sum of its parts. 

The **Pacers** have been super consistent for the whole millennium. I'll give a nod to them.

Maybe the **Mavericks** if Luka is as loyal as Dirk. Slightly more dubious because unlike the Rockets, they had to bottom out for a season to get their superstar.

4302,gzgadget6,1597363042,134,1,"So this season, the NBA is doing something brand new that it's never done before: a Play In Tournament for the playoffs. It's actually pretty basic and really short. Here's how it goes:  
  
* The 8th seed and 9th seed play each other for that final playoff spot (normally, this spot just goes to the 8 seed).  
* This ONLY happens if the 9th seed is within 4 games of the 8th seed. (So, since the Magic are 32-40, which is more than 4 games better than the 25-47 Wizards, they automatically have the 8th seed in the East).  
* This means the Grizzlies (8th seed, clinched the ""play in"" berth, but not the 8th seed until the tournament is over) will face either the Trailblazers or the Suns, depending on if the Blazers beat the Nets tonight.  
  
  
##Okay but how does the tournament actually work?  
  
It's simple:  
  
* The 8th seed (Grizzlies) win ONE single game (this Saturday), and keep the spot. OR  
* The 9th seed wins TWO games against the 8th seed (Grizzlies), and the 8th seed spot is now theirs. (so they'd win Saturday's game, then force a ""winner take all"" game on Sunday).  
  
  
I think this is an interesting little bonus the NBA has added and I'm curious to see how it plays out! Hopefully this helps some fellow confused fans like myself.

Game 1 - 9th vs 10th - winner moves on. Loser eliminated.

Ok, so I nerded out on stats again, and I realized Giannis is actually not only putting up some all time numbers this season, but he’s knocking on the door of possibly the greatest big to ever exist. 

 Wilt's 50 point season, on a 36 minute basis:  
 

37.4 points, 19.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists  
 

Giannis's current season per 36 minutes:  
 

34.9 points, 16.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists

Obvious argument against this comparison is the premise; going by a 36 minute basis. “Numbers that didn’t happen, didn’t happen”, right? Well, Mike Budenholzer, free Giannis up! He’s 25 years old, and it’s not like pace is higher than the 60’s. First recorded PACE numbers are from 73/74, with that season at 107.8. This season we're at a PACE of 100.3. Wilt played 48.5 minutes per game during the 61/62 season. Clearly that’s not going to happen again in the modern game, but wouldn’t it be amazing to see Giannis play 36-40 minutes and just start owning records?

I think the last 2 spots will be interesting. 

Is the relationship between Gobert and Mitchell completely healed? I think based off their run this year is a good indicator if they stay together or not.

NOP with a healthy Zion is dangerous man. I thought the JJ Redick streak was just as strong as the Spurs playoffs streak. Is Demar coming back, is Aldridge going to be all healed?

I don't think Giannis is a better player than Kawhi, LeBron, Curry, Harden or a healthy KD.
I still think he is quite raw and hasn't reached his potential which is crazy for me to even say since he is likely going to be a 2x MVP. In a playoff series against an elite defensive team like the clippers or OKC I would much rather take those 5 guys purely because the game plan to slow down Giannis would be slightly easier compared to the other 5 who could still average 28+ on any defense. 

Just look last year against the Raptors Giannis averaged 23/14/6 compared to Curry averaging 31/5/6 with arguably a worse team than Giannis. You can also argue he is a top 2/3 defender in the league, but I'm talking about strictly a playoff series would I choose him ahead of those 5 guys?

4469,Rockstar408,1597440516,73,1,"With the play-in games starting Saturday and playoffs on Tuesday, we expect increased activity and interest, so, we thought it would be a good idea to remind people of the subreddit's rules.
***
**1) Post Game threads will be submitted by moderators.**

For the playoffs and play-in games, we want to cut back on the ludicrousness of the new queue when games end. Please don't try to submit Post Game threads, they will be removed.

**2) Sources on stat posts**

We'd like to remind you that any post that includes a stat, must have a sufficient source. With the only exception being Post Game boxscore stats, which do not require a source

**3) Reporting comments/posts that break the rules.**

With the influx of new users there will almost certainly be an increase in trolls. Such behaviour will be met with bans. However, we can’t possibly see everything ourselves so we rely on you guys to report comments that break the rules. There aren't many rules for comments but they must be taken seriously.

These rules prohibit doxxing or personal callouts, excessive personal insults, as well as any racist, sexist, homophobic or otherwise discriminatory language. If you see comments containing the above please report them so we can take action.

**4) Personal Insults and Flamebaiting**

With the playoffs come increased tension, especially in game and post game threads. Please do not resort to excessive personal insults or flamebaiting. This is a great place to talk basketball and we don't want to make game threads entirely hostile environments. Yes, telling someone to go fuck themselves is a ban.

**5) The Theory of Bans**

We don't do explicit warnings on /r/nba because they don't work. A ban is what we use as a warning. If you get banned, message us and we can work it out with you and most likely fix your behavior and get you unbanned.

**6) ""Offseason"" Threads**

Although your team may no longer be playing, the playoffs are not a time for your hypothetical, all-time, best, worst, sandals offseason topics. Even if they are great ideas you found on /r/nfl or /r/cfb, save them for after the finals.

**7) Tweets**

Parent level tweet submissions are only for news stories, not quotes or in game updates. If you want to post a non-news tweet, you can do so by utilizing a self post and provide context.

If you are making a tweet submission please include the reporters name in brackets at the start of the post. Something like [Wojnarowski] Kyrie Irving has agreed to a 4 year, $80M contract with Lakers, sources tell ESPN. In addition, we do not allow twitter video for highlights.

**8) Highlights**

Twitter/Instagram/Vine videos are not allowed. Instead, use a native video platform like Streamable, YouTube, or Gfycat. Highlights must meet our quality standards, meaning proper native aspect ratio, resolution, and frame rate. Square videos and screen recordings are not allowed. Please ensure the title of the post also beings with [Highlight].

**9) Daily Talk Threads**

If you have minor questions such as how to find a certain stat, when the MVP is being announced etc, please ask them in the Daily Talk Thread

**10) Game-Threads**

If you are looking for the Game-Thread of a particular game, it can be found in the Daily Talk/GT Index thread stickied at the top of the subreddit.

If you are new we recommend reading all the rules, which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules)

4497,adequacivity,1597436564,34,1,"Reading the ringer on the Suns choices of bridges and cam. Bewildered and amazed, how did two NBA level shooters made it in the nba. I saw a similar take about Joe Harris, also Malcom B, and even back in the day Klay. Remember when he didn’t have the speed to play NBA d and just being a fast draw accurate shooter wasn’t something an NBA team really needed? They literally said these things during the live show, I watched it at my buddies house. More time was spent admiring the “upside” of the “dunking ninja” Jan Vesely. 

What is striking is that this nonsense continues. There are two distinct points where we all should demand better:

A. The cult of upside - some players have it, others don’t. There is no correlation between the declaration of upside and its realization. Just as you shouldn’t pay for past performance, you shouldn’t invest in hallucinations. “Upside with a shaky jumper” - last words of a fired GM.

B. Shooting is dominant. Let’s be clear the team with the most points wins, you get points when the ball falls through the hoop. In game theory an play can be dominated, a 100% 3 point shooter dominates all strategies. It really doesn’t matter if your SG isn’t heavily rebounding or assisting If their job is to shoot. The rate at which shooting dominates the game is dramatically higher than an additional assist or rebound. 

C. Lack of Bayesian thought about talent. Talent follows priors, if someone is a good shooter it makes sense that this would attenuate. If one has no shot, it won’t just appear. The upside trope depends on a frequentist coin flip vision of talent. The worst here is the idea that player age is a key driver - it isn’t. 

I have done a fair bit of computational work modeling the draft - it seems random, this isn’t because no one knows who will be good or what skills matter, but that we keep using these tired tropes that devalue likely performance of key skills for overestimated values of secondary attributes. Stop being surprised when multi year college shooters keep ending up with more “upside” than the upside players.",nba,The worst draft take: a mature NBA level shooter who doesn’t do pass/rebound so he is doomed.

[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/Ba7kvll.png)

I aggregated the average BPM of all players prior to the bubble and compared them to the average BPM of all players in the bubble. For those curious, [here is a primer on BPM](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html). I know it's not the perfect stat, but it is the only efficiency stat that can be accumulated on a game-by-game basis. I also created a filter ensuring that these players averaged more than 30 minutes per game this season. While, yes, this is a small sample size and players sat out for several of them, I think we can still take away something from the graph.

Some observations:

* Yes, there are a lot of the big names like TJ Warren and Devin Booker towards the top, but also some underrated ones I haven't heard as often. I had no idea players like Jamal Murray or Aaron Gordon had improved so much.
* BOY did the Lakers stars drop off (LeBron and AD). I don't think there's too much cause for concern though.
* There is cause for concern for the Pelicans I think. Holiday, Ingram, and Lonzo all declined? Not a good sign IMO.
* Crazy to see players who were already playing very well improve in the bubble like Harden, Dame, and Jimmy Butler.",nba,[OC] Comparing Leaps in Player BPM Before and After Bubble

4514,HighlighterTed,1597532567,8,1,"Okay, so I just thought of this 30 seconds ago so don’t hesitate to criticize. 

I wanted a solution that gets rid of the concept of your draft pick being based off your own record but that also still gives the worst teams the better picks, helping keep parody alive. 

The idea focuses around the teams choosing *other* teams to determine their draft position. The following would happen:

Instead of a lottery, right before the season starts, there’s a televised event held where franchise representatives come with their own list of teams to choose from like a draft board. The worst record in the league from the previous season gets the first choice and can choose any team. The team they choose now determines their draft position for next season, so they would choose whoever they think will be bad. The second worst record gets the second pick and so on.

Pros:

1. Teams have no reason to tank since losing won’t help their draft position. Every game will be at least somewhat competitive.

2. The worst teams still get draft based compensation to keep parody alive. Let’s be honest, it’s usually easy to determine which teams will be at the bottom of the standings before each year. 

3. This gives fanbases a reason to follow another team. As a Celtics fan, the past few seasons I’ve had reason to follow other teams closely, first the Nets, then the Kings, then the Grizzlies. I’ve watched a lot more basketball games as a result. It’s honestly fun to own another team’s draft pick.

Cons:

1. The compensation comes a year later than normal for a bottom finishing team so a team that had a terrible season has to wait til the following year to get that good draft pick.

2. It would be awkward to implement because it creates a year gap.

3. Teams might not like calling out other teams and predicting who will be bad (the positive thinking here would be rivalries could start).",nba,Idea to solve tanking

4518,-2Black2Strong-,1597531952,1,1,"Obviously there is room for upset, but adding ""very probable bets"" to a single bet you place and forming a parlay is extra profitable.

Examples :

I'm ~~emotionally hedging~~ sure the Blazers will hang around even though the Lakers will win Game 1. I place a $10 bet on Blazers +5.5.

I can place that 10 to win 9, **OR..**

I can add a combination of Celtics/Clippers/Bucks/Raptors Moneyline to my slip and make it a parlay.

I'm so sure that the Raps and Bucks will win Game 1, I'm effectively betting 10 to win 15 that the Blazers will keep it within 5. I added the Celtics and Clippers and made the following bet:

* Celtics Moneyline
* Raptors Moneyline
* Clippers Moneyline
* Bucks Moneyline
* Portland +5.5

$10 to win $41.35

As a responsible gambler - even in the event of a loss, my reasoning is that the $10 is (more than) worth the entertainment value of :

* The chaos if one of those four teams were to lose Game 1 - Sixers don't have Simmons, Playoff Pee memes, etc
* The Lakers, the team I'm rooting for, convincingly beating the Trail Blazers - silencing any upset talk and proceeding to win in 4.

This is just one of the ways I spiced up a bet. You can do this cross sport - for example, adding Bucks and Raptors Moneyline to your MLB bet as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lebron Style FInals MVP**

So, if Lebron's team wins the finals, he will, rightfully, win finals mvp. This is the law. Honestly, if there was any year a different player might take that from Lebron, it'd be this year with AD. However, the best and most important player on a team. Unscientifically, i can say that the ""lebron"" of the team will win the award 85-90% of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Pierce Style Finals MVP**

This is also known as ""pulling a James Worthy.""  Both Paul and James(both of which are good friends of mine and thus we're on first name basis) weren't necessarily considered the best player on their team when you look at it on paper or were making an all time list (KG and Magic respectively would take that spot). However, what they did in their finals series were truly undeniable. This is also known as ""the Spurs were right about that guy after all"" award, because of Tony Parker in 07 and Kawhi in 2014. Of course, 2010 Pau is not included here, but if someone could share that gif of him cheering in slow motion at the end of the last game in those finals, it'd be much appreciated. 

Note: 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Iggy style Finals MVP**   

Iggy wasn’t a slouch at all, in 2015, you could argue he was equally as important as draymond to the warriors’ success. But at the start of the playoffs, you would have expected steph to win the award. However, Iggy, while not the best player on the court, did get the award for being ""the Lebron stopper."" Similarly, though he's more in the previous section, Kawhi leonard in 2014 also got this award for similar reasons(I think the narrative was exactly the same at the time).  There aren't many Iggy style finals MVPs, but let's also include rewarding an important and contributing veteran into the qualifications to make it easier. 

So going through each of the 2020 playoff teams, who fits where? well I got you. Why should you listen to me? I don't know. but feel free to call me dumb and hurt my feelings! Let's go!

**The Paul Pierce:** ***Nurkic.*** In my eyes, Dame is going to have to go 2011 Dirk to even humor this possibility, but between Nurk and CJ to pull off some insane Dame-style heroics and win it all,  Nurk would be the guy. 

**The Iggy:** ***Carmelo Anthony.*** I put that little addendum on the bottom of the Iggy explanation so i could put Carmelo on here. It would be the ultimate feel good reward to Melo if he somehow won Finals MVP. If Melo keeps making clutch shots and plays into 

&amp;#x200B;

**Orlando Magic:** 

**The Lebron:  Vučević?** I guess this is the one? He is really good. I kind of want to put Aaron Gordon though. 

**The Pierce: Markelle Fultz.** Similar to the Spurs star maker finals mvps and the feel good winner. It has to be Fultz brushing off his draft bust title.

**The Iggy: Terrence Ross**, look, the Magic aren't winning the finals. I'm sorry. If Terrence Ross shuts down Giannis, jimmy Butler, Pascal, and Lebron on the way to a finals win, that'd do it. but I don't see it happening.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dallas Mavericks:**

**The Lebron: Luka Doncic.** I will literally rename the award the Luka if he wins the finals. 

**The Pierce: Boban**. It's probably actually Kristaps, but I'd rather it be Boban because I like Boban more. If playoff Boban exists, and he's been sitting on the greatest three point shot the league has ever seen, it's game over. He outplays AD, Jokic, and the entire clippers roster on the mavs way to the finals where he and Tobias Harris have their showdown. 

**The Iggy: Seth Curry**. Imagine for a second. Seth Curry just drilling so many threes that the Mavs can't lose. Imagine how it'd look if Seth got a finals mvp before Steph. That'd be a fun world. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Brooklyn Nets**

**The Lebron: Carris Lavert:** Lavert has taken this team and has shown that he could put them on his back. He will be a third option next year which is scary, but his ability to carry this team has been nothing short of nuts. 

**The Pierce: Tyler Johnson** honestly, Tyler Johnson has impressed so much in the bubble. It's hard not to love the kid. If this kid keeps making shots like he has, it'd be hard not to love the kid. 

**The Iggy: Jacque Vaughn** if the nets somehow win the finals, Jacque Vaughn deserves all the credit in the world. If the nets lose another player to injury, Vaughn would of course have to step up and play. (real answer, Jarrett Allen, who averages 30 offensive rebounds a game throughout the playoffs).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Utah Jazz**

**The Lebron: Rudy Gobert**. This would be weird. Rudy Gobert, somewhat unfairly, being the poster boy for not taking Covid-19 seriously enough and then leading his team to the finals. It would be weird. 

**The Pierce: Donavan Mitchell,** Donny (we're also good friends) would be considered one of the best players to be drafted over the last 5 years. there'd be debate over ""him or Luka?"" as the future face of the league. And honestly, he has the potential to be the best player on the floor during these games. It's unlikely, but it's possible. 

**The Iggy: Joe Ingles**. This path to the finals does involve PG getting Jingled again. If he's been hiding his Jingling capabilities this restart only to step up and do it all playoff long, you'd got to give it to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Philadelphia 76ers**

**The Lebron: Joel Embiid** i'm apparently weird because I think Ben Simmons is better than Embiid. But Embiid leading this team to the finals would be an absolutely insane turn of events. if he is hitting his shots and playing defense, then yeah, crown him a top 5 player in the nba. maybe even a top 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Pierce: Shake Milton:** Many moons ago, the 76ers trusted the process to find their pointguard of the future. However, if Shake Milton is playing Clippers Shake Milton for the entire playoffs, then perhaps he was the future the 76ers needed all along. If somehow he and Thybulle have a 2018 Tatum playoff run, that'd be the story, man. 

**The Iggy: Tobias Harris:** Hey he's been pretty great lately! It'd be the ultimate way to say ""yes this trade was worth it."" He could be like the Nick Foles of this 76er team. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The OKC Thunder**

  
**The Lebron: CP3**. for me personally, nothing would make me happier outside of my team winning then this. I'd be so happy for my boy CP3. He enters the top 10 point guards all time, and maybe even enters the top 5. 20 years from now history remembers him and Curry as the two best PGs of the era. 

**The Pierce: SGA**. The ultimate star making performance. If SGA becomes a playoff superstar, especially if Paul George struggles again in the playoffs and the clippers lose, it will be remembered as one of the worst trades in history. I won't even be mad, because SGA is my son and I miss him so much. He becomes a superstar. He is considered better than Lebron and Jordan combined. He thanks me personally on the podium. 

**The Iggy: Steven Adams:** the most heart and soul player the Thunder have. A player who we've spent seasons underrating playing a position that we might underrate. If the thunder win because of great pure strength and center play, then Steven Adams could win on being that throwback. 

&amp;#x200B;

  **The Indiana Pacers:** 

**The Lebron: Malcolm Brogden**. There isn't a more slept on player in the NBA then Brogden. He has impressed so much this season, and he's really shown to be an excellent point guard in the nba. If he's able to carry a team, then he will be something special for years to come. 

**The Pierce: TJ Cash Considerations Warren**. This section really should have been the star making section. TJ Warren was absolutely insane in the bubble up until the game with the Heat. If he catches fire in the playoffs. then... i mean. damn. what a story.

**The Iggy: Myles Turner**. This is a weird team. Myles Turner is very important to their success especially with Sabonis out. Any of their players could fit any category really, but Turner is who I'm going with. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Houston Rockets:** 

**The Lebron: James Harden.** Not much to say here. 

**The Paul Pierce: Russell Westbrook.** Again, not much to say here. it'd be big for him to win it all and a lot of fans from every team would be happy for him. 

**The Iggy: PJ Tucker**. the most pure Iggy player in the playoffs right now, even more so then Iggy himself. Him being the piece that makes the small ball rockets go and playing a position like center. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Miami Heat**

**The Lebron: Jimmy Butler:** yup it's jimmy butler. Honestly is a toss up between him and Bam, but he'd be considered an all time team leader if his team even makes the finals. 

**The Pierce: Bam**. Yup it's Bam. if the Heat win the finals, how many centers and/or power forwards do you really put above him? I mean, there might be a few. but damn man. 

**The Iggy: Goron Dragic:** funnily enough, it isn't Iggy who'd be the Iggy. Dragic is a slept on player and has been for years. it won't happen. Honestly there are a lot of players who are more Iggy than Iggy currently. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus: iggy:** but if iggy does win finals MVP, then, I mean, he really put something crazy together in the playoffs, honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Denver Nuggets**  
**The Lebron: Nikola Jokic**. I mean, i'm not going to give you the best reason why this take is obvious. Becomes the best center in the league and his passing vision goes up there with other all time great point guards. It'd be crazy.

**The Pierce: Michael porter Jr.** The weird kid shows that his injury didn't hamper him. Setting himself up to become a player who the Kings also regret not picking over Bagley.

**The Iggy: Paul Millsap:** This is a guy who's been a vet, who we'd all be happy for. I don't see this happening but his history in the league puts him here. **I'd Personally put Will Barton if he's playing.** Dude could carry the Nuggets in games. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boston Celtics:** 

**The Lebron: Jayson Tatum:** he already is showing he's going to be one of the most valuable people on this team going into the future. He's got star power for days. He could be a consistent top 10 player in the league every year for the next 50 years at which point he'll retire at 35. (I made the joke!). 

**The Pierce: Kemba Walker.** Who doesn't love Kemba? He's been one of the most likable players in the league and has been slept on a whole lot. His injuries have been scary, and i don't know how much longer he'll be able to be a top contributor on a great team, but here's hoping he gets one of these before he has to hang it up.

**The Iggy: Jaylen Brown.** Hey, he's kind of a weird player who definitely isn't the top prospect of the Celtics deadly wing combo, BUT his committment to being as good as he can while still openly passing the reigns to Tatum is admirable. It'd be a likable winner and his defense could do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The LA Clippers:** 

**The Lebron: Kawhi Leonard.** It'd be really weird if someone other than Kawhi wins the finals MVP for the clippers. I don't know of another finals MVP that switched teams the year after they won it, but if Kawhi gets two in a row on his third team he's won it for, it'd be pretty bonkers. 

**The Pierce: Paul George.** I mean, if only because we'll have to come up with a new joke other than ""Playoff P"" which would be a big monkey off the dude's back. If he's able to step up, and be the best player on the court, then yeah, I'd hope that he does get finals MVP.  

**The Iggy: Pat Bev.** He's just running around doin nothin. but he wins finals mvp. He's been hated but he'd be up there in terms of clippers players. I'd personally like to see him win finals mvp with us, because I love him. This sub would not, and probably for some good reasons along with some bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Toronto Raptors:** 

**The Lebron: Pascal Siakam.** I mean, dude has become a star, and has shown he could reach Kawhi-esque heights with a finals win. Showing that the team was better than their best player last year. 

**The Pierce: Kyle Lowry:** The Pierciest player in the playoffs. A dude who's stuck with a team forever and has been the heart and soul of those raptors teams. He lives up to his fat contract and we all smile. 

**The Iggy: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson.** look there are a lot of options here, but there was a game before the restart where Nick Nurse put RHJ at center. Might have happened a few times. I'm not sure. It had limitations, but Nick Nurse's use of RHJ has really elevated him beyond a dude who's on such a low contract. This isn't the best pick, but I watched those awful Nets teams and liked RHJ then, and i'm the one writing this. 

**Bonus: Patrick McCaw:** If the raptors win the finals this year, we might need to accept that McCaw is clearly magic. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The LA Lakers:** 

**The Lebron: Anthony Davis.** honestly, he's been better in the bubble. I know Lebron should be the Lebron, but that's boring. You can put Lebron as the Lebron if you want to. But the big man is a real difference maker and is going to need to be the monster he's shown he could be. This elevates him into being a top 3-5 player in the league without question. 

**The Pierce: Kyle Kuzma.** yes, his hair is dumb, but of the somewhat higher profile players the lakers drafted, Kyle Kuzma is the one that's left. And you know what, he gets shit on too much. (Not putting Lebron as the Lebron has made this entire section wrong). 

**The Iggy: Dwight Howard:** what a story this would be right? remember how many people hated the Dwight signing this summer? remember how many people hated the last 5 Dwight signings? sadly, he seems like a weirdo who doesn't want to wear a mask, which takes away some ""feel good"" points. So fuck it **Danny Green.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Milwaukee Bucks**  


**The Lebron: Giannis.** again, easy. 

**The Pierce: Khris Middleton** I mean, the bucks are pretty easy to identify finals MVPs for. Middleton is one of the most slept on players in the league and should be considered a top player but isn't because of how good he is as a number 2 guy. 

**The Iggy: Brook Lopez:** I like Brook Lopez. He is such a skilled center and is one of those pieces that the Bucks were right about while everyone else was wrong. He can shoot and be big at the same time. There's not much to say here.",nba,"(O.C.) The Pierce, The Bron, and the Iggy. Picking each ""kind"" of Finals MVP for each Playoff team"

It would change the ugly looking plays where a star player gets bumped 30 ft from the rim, falls down throwing the ball to the rim, then turning and complaining to officials that there wasn't a foul called.

1- Obviously, Embiid has to be healthy, engaged, and in shape enough to play hard and smart  (as in passing out of doubles) for 40 minutes or so a game. When he's cared in the bubble, that seems possible

2- Start Thybulle and have him make enough 3s- I'm not sure over who, but he has to be the Tatum defender, over Richardson or Milton, maybe Horford? I'm actually thinking the latter, I'm not sure who Horford guards in the starting lineup in this series.

3- This one probably won't happen, but Brown would have to be smart enough to have guards play Kanter with P and Rs off the floor when he's in, as he's the only Embiid defender they have. I don't really trust Brown to be smart enough to prioritize that though.

If all three of those happen, I think the Sixers could legitimately win.",nba,Sixers Upset?

While other teams are thinking about championship caliber moves, I’m left questioning every decision my team makes and having blind faith they’ll do something right for once. Starting off my fandom in 2002 and constantly thinking about what could’ve been and watching them repeat mistakes ever since then. It makes for a seriously deranged but incredibly loyal fan. So much so that I can even admit that it’s ludicrous to be a fan of this team for so long and yet still be a fan.

4692,KawhiMeARivers,1597606757,65,1," When the Nets began the NBA’s restart with a loss to the Magic in which they gave up 128 points, it seemed like Brooklyn’s season was a foregone conclusion. The Nets, after all, were a shell of their projected roster, with at least three regular starters and half of their rotation missing the NBA’s bubble playoffs due to injuries or COVID-19 concerns.

Since then, though, the Nets have been surprisingly frisky. They won five of their next six games, including two over championship contenders, the Bucks and Clippers. (The win over the Bucks, who were 19-point favourites, was the biggest upset in an NBA game since 1993.) The Nets dropped their final regular-season game — which was irrelevant for seeding, anyway — but saw more positive signs, with Caris LeVert scoring 37 points and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot making five triples in a near-upset of the desperate Portland Trail Blazers.

There’s no point of outlining why the Raptors should, and almost certainly will, win this series. They’re -3000 favourites — an implied probability of 96.8 per cent. Forget about that. The more interesting question is, well, can the Nets compete? And if so, how?

These teams’ four regular-season matchups were *mostly* meaningless. Toronto was missing Fred VanVleet for the first game, then Norman Powell and Marc Gasol for the final three. Brooklyn’s rotation featured a ton of Spencer Dinwiddie and Taurean Prince for all four games, plenty of Wilson Chandler and DeAndre Jordan, and not much Luwawu-Cabarrot.

# Caris LeVert

One thing about those games that’s worth mentioning: In the final two matchups — the first which came down to a potential game-winning shot that LeVert missed, the second which Brooklyn won — LeVert was excellent. He had 37 points on incredibly efficient shooting (6-of-11 twos, 6-of-7 threes, 7-of-7 FTs) on Feb. 8, when the Raptors won, 119–118. In an ugly rematch on Feb. 12, LeVert scored 20, chipping in seven rebounds, four assists and four steals in a 101–91 Nets win.

NBA.com’s tracking data (which is admittedly imperfect) [shows that](https://stats.nba.com/player/1627747/head-to-head/?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;Matchup=Offense&amp;CF=MATCHUP*E*&amp;sort=PARTIAL_POSS&amp;dir=1) Terence Davis and Fred VanVleet guarded LeVert on more possessions than any other Raptors. LeVert scored 15 points against each player, shooting 4-of-6 in 25.2 “partial possessions” against Davis and 7-of-8 (in 20.8 partial possessions) against VanVleet. In just 13.7 possessions against OG Anunoby, LeVert scored four points on 2-of-3 shooting. Expect Anunoby to match up against LeVert to start the series, with VanVleet likely chasing Harris around screens. (Unless Nick Nurse surprises everyone with an unconventional switch of the matchups, which he’s done effectively several times in the past.)

# Brooklyn’s shooting

That second loss shouldn’t be concerning for the Raptors. They were missing Gasol and VanVleet, and after a 15-game winning streak with key rotation pieces coming in and out of the lineup, they may have had an off shooting night (13-of-43, 30.2% from deep) due to sheer exhaustion.

It’s the 118 points they gave up in the first one that seems more repeatable for the Nets. True, Dinwiddie and Prince combined for 38 of those, but Harris was quiet and Luwawu-Cabarrot had an off night. Harris averaged 20 points in six seeding games, shooting a scorching 54.2% from deep (and 62% overall). Luwawu-Cabarrot scored 14.8 PPG in eight games, including 45.1% on 6.4 three-point attempts, more than double his pre-bubble volume. He also made four or more three-pointers in half of the seeding games.

The Nets were [seventh in the seeding games in offensive efficiency](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=PTS&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=07%2F30%2F2020&amp;DateTo=08%2F16%2F2020&amp;PerMode=Per100Possessions), averaging 116.2 points per 100 possessions. They attempted the [fourth-most three-pointers](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=FG3A&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=07%2F30%2F2020&amp;DateTo=08%2F16%2F2020&amp;PerMode=Per100Possessions) at 39.2 per 100 possessions, and they were middle of the pack in efficiency on those shots— 11th in the league in three-point percentage — during the seeding games. 

Toronto shot a higher percentage than Brooklyn and also made the top-10 in three-point volume, but when the Nets were hot, they were unconscious. They made 20-of-43 threes (an absurd 46.5%) against the Clippers, and while they weren’t as efficient, they still shot 21-of-57 against the Bucks. When a team scores more than 60 points beyond the arc, it’s pretty tough to beat them, or a least to put them away early. The Nets can use the variance of sheer three-point volume to stay in games. They have an otherworldly shooter in Harris, along with streaky gunners across the board — including Tyler Johnson and Garrett Temple, who combined to make nine triples against the Clippers, and an assortment of oddballs who they signed simply to have bodies, given their missing players.

# Toronto allows plenty of three-point attempts

Can the Nets get hot for four out of seven games? Even the most optimistic Brooklyn fan would say no, and that’s fine — this franchise’s plans surround their two stars, and their hopeful title window opens next year. Still, can the Nets win a game or two if the Raptors aren’t on their guard? The answer is probably yes. Toronto [allowed 38.9 three-point attempts per game](https://stats.nba.com/teams/opponent/?sort=OPP_FG3A&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season) during the regular season — the second-most attempts allowed in the league, only behind the Bucks. This is no coincidence; the two best defences in the league, on a per-100-possessions basis, give up the most three-point attempts per game. Thrown in the Clippers, who give up the fourth-most three-point attempts and have the fifth-best defensive rating.

These teams intentionally bait their opponents to take those shots. In an analytics-driven league that has proven the importance of the three, time and again, it seems odd that the best defences give up the most attempts. But wait…Toronto allows opponents to shoot just 33.7% from outside, the stingiest mark in the league. (The Clippers allow the fifth-lowest mark, while the Bucks are 15th, which may be a concern in certain matchups.)

Allowing this many attempts can make Toronto susceptible to hot shooting performances by opponents from beyond the arc, like the 16-of-44 (36.4%, not spectacular but an above-average mark) that Brooklyn shot on Feb. 8. More often than not, though, the Raptors allow below-average shooters to take those shots. They contest with the long limbs of Pascal Siakam, Anunoby, Serge Ibaka, Powell and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson flying at those shooters — or else Kyle Lowry and VanVleet getting in their grill and making the release less comfortable.

The Raptors are almost certainly going to win this series, but they shouldn’t overlook the Nets. Toronto will need to lock in on LeVert, contest the many three-point attempts the Nets will take, and try to direct those shots away from Harris and Luwawu-Cabarrot.

For the Nets, this series is a time for their young players to learn and grow. LeVert gets to try his luck as the top scorer — whether he’s auditioning for the third option role in Brooklyn, or to be a key piece in a trade that takes him elsewhere. After shooting just 4-of-21 from beyond the arc in his first playoff series with Brooklyn, Harris gets another chance as a nice complementary piece. Jarrett Allen will try to show why he should be the starter up front going forward. If these guys can win a game, that’s already more than [several experts have predicted](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29662426/nba-playoffs-2020-experts-predictions-every-opening-round-series).

Considering Brooklyn’s high-volume three-point launching and the variance it brings, don’t be surprised to see them steal one. Other than that, this series is what you would expect.

\#	|	Team	|	Δ	|	Record	|	Comment	|
--: 	|	:--	|	:--	|	:-:	|	:--	|
1	|	[](/MIL) Bucks	|	--	|	56-17	|	The Bucks finish the Bubble 3-5, and Khris Middleton missed out on a 20ppg 50/40/90 season by 2 shots, it felt like we averaged 25 TOs a game , and Giannis headbutted Mo Wagner (FYI Wagner is a fan of George Zimmerman) and was subsequently suspened for the last bubble game. Despite all that it was a decent 8-games for the Bucks. In the rarity Giannis was actually on the floor, the team had a NETRTG of +8.5, Brook Lopez appeared to find his 3-pt shot he'd been missing all season, and everyone made it through the 8 games pretty damn healthy.	|
2	|	[](/LAL) Lakers	|	--	|	52-19	|	The Lakers essentially clinched the #1 seed after beating the Clippers in the first game back from the hiatus. They went on to lose most of the other games though as many players were in and out of the lineup for resting purposes. The Blazers are an offensive machine so this should be an exciting series.	|
3	|	[](/TOR) Raptors	|	--	|	53-19	|	Solid stretch of games for the raptors to finish out the bubble. Unfortunately the majority of the games involved heavy bench play which can be tough to draw any conclusions from, but a win is a win. Hopefully having our bench play such big minutes as of late can get them better prepared for the postseason as one of our biggest struggles this year has been inconsistency from the bench.	|
4	|	[](/LAC) Clippers	|	--	|	49-23	|	Clips look really awesome, and with Harrel coming back soon, they'll have probably the best bench in the playoffs. PatBev is still hurt so while we won't be at full power, Playoff Kawhi will be a sight to see. I look forward to seeing this team in action, Hopefully they can get some rest with a swift 4-0 win (though I doubt it)	|
5	|	[](/BOS) Celtics	|	+1	|	48-24	|	""The Celtics finished the bubble strong, and are set to face the 76ers in the 1st round of the playoffs. With Ben Simmons out, not to mention the fact Embiid finished the bubble hobbled, it seems like most people are saying the Celtics should more or less breeze through the 1st round. On paper the Celtics *should* win, but with Embiid and Philly, who knows. Embiid and Horford could very well feast on Kanter and Theis, leaving Robert """"Timelord"""" Williams as the last line of defense to throw out there for 20+ minutes a game. My personal prediction is that the Celtics will drop game 1, but then the rest of the series is a rather dominant preformance by the Celtics. |
6	|	[](/DEN) Nuggets	|	+1	|	46-27	|	With the help of some, uh, ""strategic losing"", the Nuggets have landed their ideal first round matchup against the short-handed Jazz. With both Will Barton and Gary Harris missing all eight seeding games, the odds of either of them playing significant minutes in this series are slim. Fortunately, two fantastic bubble performances from Michael Porter Jr. (who has officially secured his spot in the starting lineup) and PJ Dozier should help fill the shoes that Barton and Harris have left. While the most notable matchup in this series is obviously Jokic vs. Gobert, the more important matchup for both teams is Donovan Mitchell vs. Torrey Craig. Craig has made life difficult for Mitchell this season, who only averaged 19 PPG on 30% shooting in 3 games vs Denver this year, and if the Nuggets can maintain that pressure on Mitchell, it will be tough for the Jazz to score consistently in this series.	|
7	|	[](/HOU) Rockets	|	-2	|	44-28	|	As the playoffs start, Rockets fans can only hope for the swift return of Russell Westbrook, but luckily, the Bearded One is still on the team, and when that man is on the team, you can never count us out.	|
8	|	[](/OKC) Thunder	|	+1	|	44-28	|	After Paul George forced his way to Los Angeles and local hero Russell Westbrook soon followed him out of town, it was widely anticipated that the Thunder would begin the dreaded process of tanking (cue infmaous ""0.2% to make the playoffs"" screenshot). Twelve months, one coronavirus, and 8 seeding games later, it turns out that OKC's ""tank job"" has more in common with an M1 Abrams than the Process-era Sixers. Though without any actual home court advantage, the Thunder now entire a playoff series against Westbrook's present team. With Westbrook out for at least the first game with an injury, and Harden shooting an average of under 33% from the field against OKC, the Thunder might even be favored.	|
9	|	[](/MIA) Heat	|	-1	|	44-29	|	It's playoff bubble time and I'm excited for our series against the Pacers. They've got some similarities to how we play and it'll be a series that's dependent on who's defense is better. If they're able to put a cap on our main performers then we might be out before the 2nd round. We've lost DJJ to a scary collison and thankfully it's a neck strain and not something more serious. We'll be missing him defensively and offensively since his lob chemistry with Goran is amazing. Personally, I hope this series is reminiscent of the Big 3 era Pacers vs Heat series, because it was my favorite series growing up. The finals against San Antonio were cool but the ECF against Pacers has a Indiana shaped spot in my heart.	|
11	|	[](/IND) Pacers	|	+1	|	45-28	|	All said and done in the seeing games, Indiana has clinched the fourth seed, and they now turn their sights towards the Miami Heat. The two teams are very different from their 3 playoff series in the early 2010s, but there remains no love lost between the teams and their fanbases. Miami won the season series 3-1, with the lone Pacer victory coming in the final game of the season where neither team played their ideal lineups. Indiana will likely turn to 1st team All-Bubble  member T.J. Warren for its offensive attack, but how they adjust when the stingy Heat defense forces other options will likely determine the Pacers' fate in this series.	|
11	|	[](/UTA) Jazz	|	-1	|	44-28	|	With the end of the regular season, Utah is prepared to enter the playoffs matched up against the Denver Nuggets in the first round. Mike Conley recently left the bubble for the birth of his new baby son,with no solid timetable for a playoff return. Bojan is stll out for the foreseeable future, and Ed Davis will be out with an ACL injury for a couple of weeks, so the Jazz will be short a few starters for the series.	|
12	|	[](/DAL) Mavericks	|	-1	|	43-32	|	Dallas' season may most notably go down for what other teams did to them, including Portland with the bounce of the year to push them into the play-in game over Phoenix, as well as the Rockets/Mavs opener thriller and the two Phoenix losses. Dallas was the only team with 2 players on the All-Bubble teams, which highlights how much Doncic and Porzingis carry the Mavs' offense, considering a 10 points per game difference in the whole season scoring vs bubble scoring for Porzingis. The Mavs have a tough first round matchup vs my #1 team, the Clippers, who get Harrell back. The Mavs must get a well-rounded game from the reserves and role players in order to make noise in the playoffs.	|
13	|	[](/PHI) 76ers	|	--	|	43-30	|		|
14	|	[](/POR) Trail Blazers	|	+1	|	35-39	|	Heroic efforts from Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic dragged the Blazers into the playoffs. If they hope to compete with the Lakers, though, they'll need more success guarding the perimeter and complementary players will need to hit open jumpers when Lillard is double teamed.	|
15	|	[](/PHX) Suns	|	+4	|	34-39	|	Last power rankings I said the Suns were going 8-0 and making the play-in... and I was 1 Caris Levert jumper from that prediction coming true. Suns finished 8-0 in the bubble and with the way they were playing, had they made the play in, they would have won it. If you want some spice - the Suns would have taken AT LEAST two from the Lakers. Some say the bubble Suns were a flash in the pan but was it really? The Suns finished the regular season with a higher net rating than three playoff teams but lost 8 one possession games this year and dropped more than 10 games in which they led by double digits points. A couple bounces here and there and this team could have been easily in with no play-in. The forecast is definitely sunny in PHX	|
16	|	[](/BKN) Nets	|	+4	|	35-37	|	Let's see if Caris can sneak a game away from the stifling Raptors defense. We expect to see a lot of Caris vs OG in this series with all other major ball handlers being.... back up talent at best. The Raptors have played the Nets very well in the past so a 5 game series is really the ultimate goal here. 	|
17	|	[](/MEM) Grizzlies	|	-3	|	34-39	|		|
18	|	[](/ORL) Magic	|	-2	|	33-40	|	Isaac tearing his ACL and nagging injuries to Evan, AG and MCW really put a damper on the last few weeks. Guess it's about getting some more playoff experience and looking towards the draft and next season. WeltHam have some questions to answer this offseason, and I don't think bringing in a healthy Chuma and a near-lotto pick will be enough to quell the fanbase.	|
19	|	[](/SAS) Spurs	|	-2	|	32-39	|		|
20	|	[](/NOP) Pelicans	|	-2	|	30-42	|		|
21	|	[](/SAC) Kings	|	--	|	31-41	|	The Kings did not get the bubble miracle many had hoped for going just 3-5, but things are looking up in Sacramento after the recent resignation of Vlade Divac. An underrated part of this is the increased likelihood that a new GM will want their own coach and the Kings can be freed from Luke Walton. Will it be Sam Hinkie? What if Daryl Morey finds himself looking for a job? Regardless the new GM will have some interesting decisions to make this offseason. Keep an eye on the impending free agency of Harry Giles.	|
22	|	[](/WAS) Wizards	|	--	|	25-47	|	“You are learning something every day. A [rookie] has brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are [in the bubble] the more experience you are sure to get.” - L Frank Baum, the Wonderful Wizard of [Ish Smith]	|
23	|	[](/CHA) Hornets	|	--	|	23-42	|		|
24	|	[](/CHI) Bulls	|	--	|	22-43	|	Jim Boylen was fired, after going 39-84 with our young squad.. Though the firing came 620 days too late, the Bulls once again look toward the future. The 2020-2021 season looks to be the third year straight in which we Bulls fans get optimistic for another 8-seed run. After all, after this draft we'll finally have all the pieces, right? ..... RIGHT?	|
25	|	[](/ATL) Hawks	|	--	|	20-47	|	Wouldn't it just be the most Hawks thing of all time to win the draft lottery in one of the worst draft lotteries in the last 20 years? Cause that's 100% what's going to happen. 	|
26	|	[](/DET) Pistons	|	--	|	20-46	|	The Pistons finished the season a tire-fire. They won a single game after trading Andre Drummond and had advanced stats on par with historically awful teams. Christian Wood looked awesome but he's a free agent and his future is uncertain. With a clean cap sheet and a new GM in place everything is on the table for the Pistons future.	|
27	|	[](/MIN) TWolves	|	+1	|	19-45	|	Wolves are once again hoping the ping pong balls bounce their way in the lottery. Despite being a mainstay at this event they have never moved up their position in the lottery.	|
28	|	[](/NYK) Knicks	|	--	|	21-45	|	Stay Melo	|
29	|	[](/CLE) Cavaliers	|	--	|	19-46	|	After being cut from the bubble, there was a few members of the team that were upset they didn’t get a chance to get additional reps with the team as the season winded down in Orlando. We also have had a few stories come out in regards to us having high hopes for next season. Our young guys took great steps this season, with Sexton putting up good PPG and ultimately looking like he’s learning how to create opportunities when faced with a NBA-level defense. I’m excited to see what Garland and Jr are able to do next season!	|
30	|	[](/GSW) Warriors	|	--	|	15-50	|	Klay's on Catalina Island doing bicep curls with Rocco, literally. Most interesting development was packaging Wiggins and the pick for Siakam...which would be a great fit and why wouldn't Toronto want Maple Jordan? IT apparently wants to play for GS and come off the bench, we already have Jordan Poole playing no defense and chucking though.	|",nba,Official /r/nba Power Rankings #11 - Gone Fishing (08.17.2020)

Finally after his eighth he gets a weird feeling and comes to his senses about what is really bothering him. He’s sitting far enough away from the small band playing in the back of the bar, the only one let into the bubble, to hear it well. Instead, he has just been listening to angering, faint bits of what is being played across the bar.

He asks the bartender, “These guys, the band, who are they?”

“I don’t know em that well myself, they’re not the biggest score we could get in my mind, it’s almost like we never score around here.”

The man thinks for a second and drunkenly replies, “Boy can I relate. I feel like I’m the only one that scores on my team! Say, what kind of music are they playing, anyways? I can’t seem to get the faint sounds out of my head!!”

First off, he’s had a fantastic season. This post isn’t meant to hate on him. He’s been crazy efficient all year. His raw counting stats don’t tell the full story as his leadership provides so much to a Thunder team that was supposed to rebuild this year. He’s also been one of the best players in the clutch this season. While his defense has taken a step back from his perennial all-defense days, he’s still solid on that end as well.

But a surprising amount of people attribute all of OKC’s success this year to him alone, as if he’s more impactful than Russ and PG combined. In reality, there’s many factors that contribute to OKC’s success in 2020. 

##Schroder

Dennis Schroder has improved so much this year. He went from an above average bench PG to top 3 6MOY candidate. Donovan is using him differently on offense (more on that later) and on defense he’s improved a lot, hounding ball handlers as they come up the court and pressing them hard.  But similar to CP3, stats don’t tell the full story. The more telling story is his crazy impact on his teams performance. Here’s a look at how Paul and the Thunder perform with CP3 and Schroder vs with CP3 alone. 

CP3 without Schroder: 24.0 PTS, 10.6 AST, 3.7 TO, 9.0 FTA, 111.6 ORTG, 111.8 DRTG, -0.3 NETRTG, 1.7 AST/TO, 54.5% eFG%, 58.4% TS, 98.72 Pace

CP3 w/ Schroder: 30.9 PTS, 10.2 AST, 3.4 TO, 3.7 FTA, 114.9 ORTG, 99.4 DRTG, +15.6 NETRTG, 1.78 AST/TO, 55.5% eFG, 60.9% TS, 104.48 Pace

[Source for per 100 stats](https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2019-20&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612760&amp;PlayerId=203471), everything else is from NBA.com. 

CP3 improves individually in every single category when playing with Schroder. He puts up better stats per 100 on higher efficiency. The team as a whole plays far better with Schroder as well - **when CP3 plays without Schroder, the Thunder have a negative net rating**. With Schroder, that number shoots up from -0.3 to +15.6. 

He’s also shooting incredibly well this year, going from 34% 3PT to 39% 3PT. Last year teams would always go under the screen when he ran PnR and he provided very little actual spacing for his team.

I strongly believe he deserves 6MOY this year over Lou Will or Harrell

##Shai Gilgeous-Alexander 

Shai has shown out as well - he continued to grow and in his second year went from 11/3/3 to 19/6/3 while improving his efficiency and further improving his defense. His size and versatility are a huge plus for this Thunder team, as his ability to effectively guard wings allows the Thunder to run their 3 guard lineups. Things like that showcase how well their roster fits together and suits Donovan’s schemes better than last years roster. 

##Spacing

The Thunder’s spacing has improved so much this year. If you look at raw 3PT% and don’t watch the games it doesn’t look too bad - they’re shooting roughly the same (went from 34.8% to 35.5%) but actually watching them they’re a completely different animal. Yes, Ferguson and Grant shot pretty good from 3 last year but teams frequently sagged off of them and ignored them at times. Russ would drive into a crowded paint and STILL get those shooters open. With CP3/Schroder/Shai/Gallo they have so much more space to work on offense. 

Even when it came to converting those open looks they were horribly inconsistent. Everyone on that 18-19 Thunder team had random super hot and cold streaks. Unfortunately they all went ice cold right around the playoffs. They were cold as a team going in, PG and Russ were injured, and Ferg/Grant were ice cold outside of Game 3 where Grant shot 5/5. Spacing was a huge issue and that roster was extremely poorly constructed outside of Russ and PG

##Danilo Gallinari

Gallinari has been a fantastic spacer and offensive threat for the Thunder this year. He is shooting a whopping **41%** from 3 this year, top 20 in the league.

He’s always been fantastic on offense but his health has struggled massively as he’s dealt with a ton of injuries in the past. From 2010-18 he started only 335 of a possible 656 games. This year however, he’s been fantastic and has had no injury issues. This brings me to my next point...

##Impressive Health and Lack of Injuries

People love to clown on the preseason predictions for the Thunder now, but coming into this season it wasn’t just underrating that roster. Many expected CP3/Gallo/Adams to be traded. One huge point was that all of those players were very injury prone coming into this year as well. 

CP3 played EVERY SINGLE GAME for the Thunder this year after missing nearly a third of last season. His injury the year before cost the Rockets a chip. Gallinari, despite his aforementioned injury issues, only missed 8 games this season. 

They have Roberson coming back for the playoffs and he’s looked great so far in his limited time back. He’s one of the best defenders in the league but missed both playoff runs with Russ and PG. 

##Billy Donovan

Donovan is coaching far better this year than years past. Back when they had Russ, PG, KD, etc. I always felt like those teams could have used more of a “player’s coach” than Donovan. He’s always been great at developing young players but he’s not the coach I’d want to coach those sorts of teams. His coaching acumen was wasted as he wasn’t the right style of coach that those rosters needed. 

Russ and PG almost never ran set plays. they were successful mainly due to how crazy talented they were. so they weren’t elevated at all by donovan who is a great player development and X’s and o’s coach. Meanwhile, CP3 and these young guys aren’t as talented but their on court play is elevated a lot because of how well they fit together as a system.

They didn’t straight up lose Russ and PG, they traded them and got multiple good players in exchange. That sort of personnel is always going to be a better fit for a coach like Donovan, as opposed to a more heliocentric roster.

The Thunder are not playing better this season because Russ and PG left. they’re better in large part because Donovan is able to run his sets and plays more often with this personnel that’s far better suited for his specific scheme. he may not be inventing new plays but his coaching this year is def different more hands on compared to earlier.

From an X’s and O’s perspective they’re doing different things this year. for example their 3 PG lineups. it worked horribly last year in spurts with Schroder and Felton but this year he has a rising star in Shai who can make that work. among other things. Their personnel this year better fits what scheme he wants to run. 

They went from just giving the ball to Russ and PG and letting them carry the offense to actually running a structured offense. This year they run 2-3 guards running dribble handoffs and other actions on the perimeter, looking for a mismatch they can exploit. 

**Overall, the Thunder have played better this year than in years past. While CP3 plays a huge role in that, he is getting all of the credit for their progress when in reality it is due to a multitude of factors. I hope people have a greater appreciation for the entire OKC squad after reading this.**",nba,"CP3 has been fantastic this season, but people are criminally underrating the huge contributions of the rest of the Thunder roster and the improvement of Billy Donovan."

Philadelphia already has a point guard, that refuses to shoot threes. This prevents their star center from reaching his full potential, due to the terrible spacing.

They could have used the money to sign some much needed shooters like Seth Curry, Brogdon, Bojan Bodgonvic or some other free agents. Instead they decided to sign another center?

**The Money:**

I could understand signing Horford if he wants to come on a reasonable contract, but that wasn't even the case here. They signed him for $109,000,000/4 years, not even Boston matched that and they really needed a center like Horford. Not to mention Horford is gonna be 37 once the contract expires.

   &gt;A) Tobias Harris is a mid-level exception player masquerading as a $180 million star wing.

    &gt;B) Al Horford is being paid over $100 million to play out of position and complicate life even further for the star player who plays the same position he does.

   &gt;C) The front office put in place by a man who resigned in disgrace after leaking private medical information and disparaging his own players was allowed to stay on after he threw his wife under the bus for his transgressions, and later spearheaded the most important moment of the last two decades for the franchise by a first-time executive.

   &gt;D) Brett Brown has proven unable to build a cohesive system using the parts on hand and has lost the ability to properly motivate the stars expected to drive the program forward.

&gt;If you answered all of the above, congratulations for paying too much attention to this kicked puppy of a basketball team. Your prize is getting to stick around after this season comes to a miserable conclusion to see how little they're able to do about it in the months and years to come.

&gt;Wednesday's Game 2 loss was a culmination of something far beyond this miserable, meandering season. It has taken years of work, the efforts of many, to thoroughly derail what looked like an extremely promising situation as recently as two years ago.

&gt;What's worse is everyone knows they have a distressed property. They have gone from the young darling of the league to a bloated version of the John Wall/Bradley Beal Wizards, paper champions paying extravagant money to ordinary players.

&gt;It isn't, strictly speaking, Harris or Horford's fault they're being paid to be players they're incapable of being. A person's worth in the business world is either what they can make for themselves or what someone else is willing to give them. Getting a sucker to pay you above your value is shrewd maneuvering if nothing else.

&gt;It goes a long way toward explaining how one organization could think Markelle Fultz and Jimmy Butler were the needed missing pieces to go to the promised land with Embiid and Simmons, only to throw the gross domestic product of a small island nation at a center who they wanted to play power forward next to their max-contract center, and a power forward they wanted to play small forward before their point guard eventually made the switch to power forward.

&gt;There is no coherent vision. There are a bunch of names and attempts at procuring star power, without consideration that perhaps all they needed was time and small tweaking. Not this franchise — they wanted to go after LeBron James. They wanted to trade a hometown kid in the draft for extra ammo on the star-trading market. They wanted to get the guy who tortured Embiid as a rival and has caused him even more strife as his frontcourt partner.

&gt;Not even their wins feel good. The first-round pick they get from Oklahoma City this year had to be recovered by trading a No. 1 overall pick that busted to get back an asset they traded to draft a European stiff who never played for the franchise. The rookie wing who has excited fans cost them extra picks when they tipped the pick so bad that draft writers, let alone executives, covered their interest in him before the draft even started. They got a year of revitalized Furkan Korkmaz only after declining his option the year before and basically declaring they didn't believe he was an NBA player.

&gt;An easy out from this situation does not exist. The toxic contracts for last offseason's big signings are only getting moved if a team is so desperate for relevance they're willing to take on semi-notable players at the cost of extra Philadelphia assets. 

&gt;Even that scenario is fraught with issues. If NBA teams are playing in empty arenas waiting for a vaccine to open their doors again, they have no reason to hemorrhage money for mediocre players that legally cannot put butts in the seats. Even if there were takers, unloading extra assets just to dump Horford and Harris sets back a team that has already hit the accelerator. There is no turning back now — tell Embiid and Simmons that it's not time to win anymore, and you might as well beg them to submit trade requests. It would be an outcome they've earned.

&gt;In spite of all of this, the only man who has ever faced public pressure or leaked reports about their job security in the middle of a playoff series is the guy who had to take bullets from the public and the press for the failings of multiple front offices, multiple medical staff leaders, and professional basketball players who can't be bothered to use a fundamental basketball skill in a game of any consequence",nba,"[Neubeck] The Sixers are screwed, and there’s no clear solution"

But this whole ""Clippers and Lakers are going to the WCF, no doubt"" argument is getting old at this point. Both teams have showed glaring problems in games, but the media refuses to give those problems any weight, to prevent the hype machine to stop working.

If a random person started watching the NBA today, he or she would probably think the Clippers are coming off multiple championships and are the favourites to win it all just off that, when in reality, they only ""championship"" asset they have is Kawhi Leonard, while Paul George is known to be a Playoffs liability, yet here we are, Dallas showing up big in game 2, yet people still make excuses and give the Clippers the edge as if they're god's gift to mankind.

5023,RVA_Rooster,1597920938,28,1,"**LAKERS**  
In short, no, not yet. Inside the NBA has to have narratives to create argument ""sides"" (see [this video for proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WmMj4lfpdc)).  


 In the Game 1 2018 loss against a scorching hot Celtics team, LeBron's (team) lost the only other first game in the first round, other than against Portland. LeBron would have had at least 21 assists if the team shot even 2% below average from 3. AD missed bunnies he usually makes, around 5. Meanwhile, while Portland didn't shoot great, they shot well enough to take the W, with clutch shots down the stretch.  The 8th seed beat the 1 seed in the first game of the first round in the West to a team that doesn't FEEL like an 8th seed at all. It happens. Especially when a team makes 5 3pt shot while shooting over 30. If both teams shot average, it's a different story. But it didn't, Portland seized the opportunity for a crucial win.   


""Game 1 has always been a feel-out game for me, if you've ever followed my history,"" he said after the [Cavaliers](http://bleacherreport.com/cleveland-cavaliers) fell 108-83 Sunday night to Boston in Game 1. Found [here](https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2018/05/13/cavs-celtics-lebron-james-game-2).  


With AD shooting well below his 52% career average from either a bad night, good defense, a bent rim, doesn't matter. I believe 4 Portland players including 3 starters had 5 fouls with 4 minutes left. This is when he should have caught and demanded the ball low in the post and gone to work.  


**BUCKS**  
In short, no, not yet. Giannis had a great game, but Vucevic outshone the assumed MVP. With similar shooting woes and a TWELVE man rotation by Bud (with players 10-12 contributing little to nothing). All the 30 minute Giannis games were wasted by the pandemic, but Bud can't be blamed for a leaked pandemic ravaging the world.  


But as a team, starters like BroLo have to do better than 5/4/1 in 30 minutes. DiVincenco has do to better than 2 points in 13 minutes (much like a KCP, they had bad nights).   


It did take a historic night by Big Vu to win, but it was a blowout win of 10+ is the only concern. They let Giannis get his, and focused on locking down a 12-man rotation that should have been 8-10 at most. With bodies like Vuc, Fournier, Gordon able to get theirs, it's just simple math.

But like the Lakers, I believe Bud and Vogel are both historically great counter coaches and will gameplan better the second time around. LeBron will still offer wide open shots, but more than Kuz has to make them.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, it's ONE GAME. The Lakers and Bucks don't have anything to worry about unless they stick to their game 1 plan. Shooting will improve, as much as Rondo gets shit on, playoff Rondo may be back for Game 2, and he's still a real thing from the looks, improving his shooting greatly in his later years. Bud has to play less than 12 players with 2-3 contributing nothing (even though I know some was garbage time, it's the 8 man rotation going 5 pts and 4 rebounds as a big in 30 mins).  


Just my 2 cents. Hope you enjoyed the write up. But if either team underestimates an 8 seed, we COULD see a very close to or even possible upset.",nba,Should the Lakers and Bucks be concerned?

Also one thing i'd like to say is to not underestimate the bench of the All Balkan team because even tho you don't know a lot of these names, they still get decent amount of playtime on different teams. 

I'd say this would be a close, but winnable game for both teams, probably goes to game 7.

Wiggins stands at 6-foot-7, and in the era of small ball, it would make sense if he played up a position from his usual small forward spot at times. He currently is one of the Warriors' four best players, and depending on who they land in the draft, their best five-man lineup could require him to play the four.

The Blake and CP3 era - despite the fact that it definitely wasn’t always Doc’s fault - has to be considered a disappointment by never making the conference finals. The urgency is even stronger this time around, given the length of Kawhi and Paul George’s deals and the number of future assets they traded. 

I do think Doc is a good coach. I saw first hand how well he can get star players to sacrifice for the good of the team and win a title. But I think it’s clear that he simply hasn’t gotten the Clippers to play with a sense of urgency this year, and time is running out.
